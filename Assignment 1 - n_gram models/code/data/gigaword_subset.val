At the airport itself, palates of various types of assistance were stacked in front of some hangers, and one military transport plane landed shortly after Clinton's U.S. Air Force jet. Before the weekend quake struck, Clinton had planned a longer stay in Chile, but she will now only spend a few hours there before heading to Brazil. Clinton is in the midst of a weeklong, six-nation tour of Latin America that has taken her already to Uruguay and Argentina. Her Santiago visit was expected to be confined to the airport and its immediate vicinity. At the airport, she met with Bachelet, the outgoing president, and President-elect Sebastian Pinera. Santiago is the second major earthquake zone Clinton has visited in the past two months. Four days after Haiti was hit with a devastating temblor in January, she was on the ground at the Port-au-Prince airport, meeting with Haitian officials and assessing damage with disaster relief experts. In addition, since she has been secretary of state, Clinton has also been traveling abroad and present in at least three foreign countries -- Honduras, Japan and Pakistan -- when they have been struck by quakes or strong aftershocks.The White House has settled up its Olympic bets. Press secretary Robert Gibbs showed up for his daily briefing for reporters Friday in a Team Canada jersey and announced that two cases of beer are being sent to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper. The U.S. embassy will be delivering a case each of U.S.- brewed Yuengling Lager and Molson Canadian. Gibbs lost wagers on the outcome of the Olympic gold medal hockey games between the men's and women's U.S. and Canadian teams to Dimitri Soudas, Harper's chief spokesman. President Barack Obama made the beer bet with Harper on the men's game. "I am making good on my aspect of my wager with Dimitri, my Canadian counterpart, who is somewhere several hundred miles north, laughing," Gibbs said. The jersey had Gibbs' name on the back and bore the number 39, which the number of U.S. team goalie Ryan Miller. While the men's U.S. team lost to Canada 3-2 in the Feb. 28 gold medal game, Miller was named the most valuable play of the Vancouver Winter Olympics hockey tournament. The Canadian women's hockey team beat the U.S. 2-0 for the gold medal. Gibbs fulfilled the terms of his bet by showing up at the briefing in the Team Canada jersey then peeled it off to reveal a U.S. hockey team jersey underneath.The Ukrainian parliament speaker says the majority "Orange" coalition led by Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko has dissolved. Speaker Volodymyr Lytvyn told parliament on Tuesday that the coalition had been unable to prove it was still together after pro-Western Tymoshenko lost last month's presidential election to Russia-friendly candidate Viktor Yanukovych. Ukraine's political parties must now form a new majority coalition and are most likely to group around Yanukovych's Party of Regions. Yanukovych says that if no majority can be reached he will disband parliament and call snap elections.Cuba will not attend the Central American and Caribbean Games in Puerto Rico this summer because it is unhappy with visa restrictions and other regulations. The Cuban Olympic Committee said on Friday it was forced into the decision by the "failure to meet demands" presented by organizers of the games, which begin on July 17 in Mayaguez. Those demands included extending visas to all officials Cuba wanted to bring, providing adequate security, and not subjecting the Cuban delegation to extra screening after the U.S.-imposed stricter airline security measures on Cubans and citizens from 13 other nations. Puerto Rican authorities claim the communist Cuban government is simply making a political statement. Puerto Rico is a self-governing territory of the United States and subject to U.S. jurisdiction, and Washington does not have formal diplomatic relations with Cuba. "Cuba's problem is not a sports one, it's a political one," said Puerto Rican Senator Carmelo Rios. "They are more worried about how many people are going to defect than they are about what they can achieve in competition." The announcement by Cuba on Friday had been expected after official newspapers hinted the country would not attend the games. Final word came in a statement read by Olympic committee head Jose Ramon Fernandez during a ceremony with athletes from many national teams at Havana's Sports Palace, a vast expanse of gymnasiums, tracks, fields and courts. Among the demands, Cuba asked that "lodging and transportation conditions be the same as those extended to other delegations," and sought a guarantee that authorities would not seize the plane that brought its delegation to Puerto Rico as payment for U.S. property nationalized after Fidel Castro took power in 1959. Similar demands that were not met prompted Cuba to pull out of the 2002 Central American Games in El Salvador. The island also skipped the games in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas in 1959, shortly after Castro took power. Cuba traveled to Puerto Rico to participate in the Central American Games in the cities of San Juan in 1966 and Ponce in 1993. It returned to the island for the inaugural World Baseball Classic in 2006. Its statement on Friday criticized Puerto Rico, though, noting that "accumulated experience from other events in Puerto Rican territory have not been good." Some Cuban athletes have left their teams and defected during international competitions, with members of the national teams in baseball, boxing, football, judo, wrestling and volleyball among those who left in recent years -- including some Olympic and world champions. Cuba won the medal count during the last Central American Games, in 2006 in Cartegena, Colombia. The island amassed 138 golds, 86 silvers and 61 bronzes, the 11th time Cuba won the most medals during the regional games.Midfielder Jason Culina will captain Australia in its Asian Cup football qualifier against Indonesia this week, coach Pim Verbeek announced Tuesday. Culina, 29, has played 44 matches for Australia and was seen as a leading candidate for the captaincy in a squad drawn largely from Australia's domestic A-League. Verbeek announced the appointment of the Gold Coast United player at a news conference in Brisbane. Australia needs a least a draw from Wednesday's qualifying match at Suncorp Stadium to be sure of a place in the 2011 Asian Cup in Qatar. "It's a very important game there's no doubt about that," said Verbeek. Culina, who will lead Australia for the first time, said he had confidence in his side's ability to qualify. "It's a privilege to be captain," he said. "It's an important game. We need to get a result to get to the Asian Cup and I'm confident we'll do that." Indonesia can no longer qualify for Qatar, but striker Bambang Pamungkas said his team was determined to give a strong performance for its fans. "We'll make sure this isn't easy for Australia," he said. "The result is not important to our team, but the game is very important for us This is the first time since 1996 that we haven't (qualified) in the Asian Cup. "We should have won the last game against Australia (which finished in a 0-0 draw). We had many chances and should have taken them."Arab foreign ministers meeting in Cairo agreed on Wednesday to back indirect Palestinian-Israeli talks for a duration of four months, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told AFP. "The Arab foreign ministers meeting at the Follow-Up Committee have agreed to aid the holding of indirect talks between Palestinians and Israelis," Erekat said. "This is so that American efforts to revive the peace process will succeed." Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas began talks on Tuesday with the members of the Arab Follow-Up Committee to weigh up holding indirect talks with Israel. The meetings encompassed a US proposal for the resumption of the talks. Participants at the meeting said talks should be based on the principles of the Arab peace initiative, which calls for a normalisation of relations between Arabs and Israel in exchange for a full withdrawal by Israel from Arab land, the creation of a Palestinian state and an "equitable" solution for Palestinian refugees. The Arab Follow-Up Committee comprises representatives from Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen and the Palestinian Authority.The White House says it's screening potential candidates to be members of the Federal Reserve and hopes to move swiftly to fill openings. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is leading the search. There are two vacancies on the Fed's seven-member board. On Monday, the Fed's second-highest ranking official, Donald Kohn, announced he'll step down at the end of June. Kohn's departure would create a third vacancy, giving President Barack Obama a chance to reshape the central bank. "We're very cognizant, obviously, of the vacancies, and understanding the importance of them, want to get those filled quickly," White House spokesman Robert Gibbs tells reporters Tuesday.BLAME THE CHEESEBURGERS The cheeseburger defense is being invoked again at the White House. As Barack Obama ran for office, whenever questions of his ordinary-man credentials arose, his aides were quick to say that he loves a good burger. As he worked to win over male voters, a stop at a beer joint would suddenly be on his itinerary. But when the cameras weren't rolling, he was just as likely to have a healthy plate of sea bass and steamed vegetables as a burger and fries. After a weekend medical exam found that the president's bad cholesterol has climbed 42 points since 2007, suddenly the burger defense -- and his penchant for having too much dessert -- were on full display at the daily White House news briefing on Monday. "You guys think he eats carrots and celery," said the press secretary, Robert Gibbs. "There's more cheeseburgers, fries and pie than you previously knew." Gibbs also conceded that the president had been unable to stop smoking. So where does he get his cigarettes? "I don't smoke," Gibbs said, "so I don't know the answer." Under repeated questioning, Gibbs appeared to be taking a measure of delight that he was no longer fending off questions about whether Obama was out of step with ordinary Americans. With high cholesterol, a sweet tooth and a hankering for an occasional smoke, Gibbs said, the president faces the same challenges "millions and millions of people across the country do." "You guys thought he, like, carried arugula in his pocket to snack on," Gibbs said, a wide grin growing across his face. -- JEFF ZELENY CHALLENGES LEFT AND RIGHT Sen. Blanche Lincoln, the Arkansas Democrat who was already facing a difficult bid for re-election, has a new problem. The state's lieutenant governor, Bill Halter, announced Monday that he would mount a primary challenge from the left. "I'm running for the United State Senate because Washington is no longer working for this neighborhood or for families all across Arkansas," Halter said in a video message on his campaign Web site. Lincoln is counted among the most politically endangered moderate Democrats in the Senate. For months, she has declined entreaties by some party leaders to opt not to run again, as several of her Democratic colleagues in the Senate have. "I know that I am the target of both political extremes, but that's what makes this campaign so important to all of us," Lincoln said. "This Senate seat belongs to Arkansas, not to outside groups that are angry. I don't answer to them." The White House said President Barack Obama would support Lincoln, continuing a pattern of backing Democratic incumbents. Halter, who is in his first term, served as a deputy commissioner of the Social Security Administration under President Bill Clinton. More than a half-dozen Republicans are seeking their party's nomination for the Senate seat. -- JEFF ZELENYMichael Owen has hinted for the first time at the true depth of his frustration at being cast into the shadows by England manager Fabio Capello. Owen has been consistently ignored by Capello since the Italian took charge and will once again be at home in Cheshire when England play Egypt in Wednesday's World Cup warm-up. For nearly two years Owen has maintained a dignified silence over his international exile, but the mask slipped for just a moment in the aftermath of Sunday's bittersweet 2-1 League Cup final win against Aston Villa. After spending much of the season as a bit-part player with United, Owen was handed a rare moment in the spotlight as he started ahead of Wayne Rooney at Wembley. He seemed determined to seize the opportunity and rolled back the years with an effervescent display capped by a superb 13th minute strike to cancel out James Milner's early penalty. With Capello watching from the stands, Owen had proved he still has the ability to make his mark on the game's grandest stages. Yet before the half was over, Owen's day had taken an all too familiar turn as he pulled up with a hamstring injury. Suddenly it was easy to see why Capello isn't prepared to risk gambling on such a fragile player and Owen must have know his faint hopes of going to South Africa were over. Perhaps that was behind his revealing response when he was asked if he felt his England chances had taken another blow. "I've said many times it's difficult for me to talk about it or find the right words because one slip of the tongue and I'm going to be on the back page," he said. "If I said what I think or how I feel...I would only be lying to you if I spoke about England so there is no point in asking, put it that way. "I didn't even know the England manager was watching. I just wanted to play well and win the trophy." After such a day of conflicting emotions, Owen could be forgiven for being in combative form when he faced reporters following the match. Owen admitted the injury is likely to keep him out for several weeks but he insisted he has no regrets about making the move to Old Trafford. "It's not been difficult to accept my role here. I would like to play a lot more obviously but you try getting in the team with Wayne Rooney playing like this!" he said. "If Wayne hadn't have been scoring two or three in every game then the manager might have rotated a bit more and I would have got more games, so there is no way I am unhappy with my decision or how things have gone. "Out of 43 games we've played this year I have been involved in 42. No-one had been writing about injuries for a good while but everyone will have a field day again now. "I've played at teams that have not been doing well in the league and I would prefer to play a lesser role if I can play and train with real top-level players every day. Then when you do play you are playing in a game like this. "Obviously it's a little sour note me having to come off and being out for a few weeks but I suppose that can't disguise the pleasure you get from scoring, winning and picking up the trophy. It's days like that you remember for the rest of your career." Although Owen will miss a portion of United's title run-in and Champions League challenge, he hopes to be back in time to play a role in the decisive final matches. "The season is not over and there's everything to play for. I'm not a doom monger. There are plenty of people who want to put a negative spin on things, but I'm too long in the tooth and have seen it all before," he said. "There are plenty of big games coming up, I've just had a child the other day, I've got four kids and I'm playing for one of the biggest teams in Europe. "It's not all doom and gloom is it? I've got every reason to have a smile on my face."A senior US diplomat was due in China Tuesday for talks aimed at getting Sino-US relations back on track, with tensions high over US arms sales to Taiwan and a White House visit by the Dalai Lama. US Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg will also focus on efforts to bring North Korea back to stalled nuclear disarmament negotiations, and try to persuade Beijing to back new sanctions against Iran over its atomic programme. Steinberg, who will be accompanied by Jeffrey Bader, Obama's top Asia adviser on the National Security Council, will head to Tokyo on Thursday for talks with Japanese officials before heading home. State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said Beijing and Washington needed to put aside their differences -- over everything from Taiwan and Tibet to Internet freedom and the value of the yuan -- to move forward. "We've gone through a bit of a bumpy path here and I think there's an interest, both within the United States and China, to get back to business as usual as quickly as possible," Crowley told reporters on Monday. The spokesman said the visit by Steinberg and Bader offered an opportunity to "refocus on the future" of relations between the US and China, the world's largest and third-largest economies. When he took office in January 2009, US President Barack Obama promised to broaden the Sino-US relationship. In July last year, he said that relationship would "shape the 21st century". The US president made his maiden official visit to China with much fanfare in November. But since then ties have faltered, with Beijing angry over the January approval of a 6.4-billion-dollar arms package to Taiwan and Obama's meeting last month at the White House with the Dalai Lama. China considers Taiwan, which split from the mainland at the end of a civil war in 1949, part of its territory awaiting reunification. China vilifies the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader who fled his homeland in 1959, as a separatist. Sino-US ties have also been affected by Internet giant Google's threats to pull out of the emerging Asian market over cyberattacks and government web censorship, and a variety of trade and currency issues. "We have a very broad, deep, complex relationship with China. There are many areas where we have achieved a consensus view. North Korea would be a great example of that," Crowley said. "There are some areas where we do not yet have a convergent view. Iran might be an example of that," he added, noting that both subjects were on Steinberg's agenda in Beijing. The six-party talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons drive, hosted by China, have faltered since Pyongyang stormed out in April last year, a month before staging a second nuclear test. Pyongyang says it cannot return until UN sanctions are lifted and it receives a US commitment to discuss a formal peace pact, replacing the armistice which ended the 1950-1953 war on the Korean peninsula. On Iran, the United States and China are divided, with Washington pushing for tough new sanctions against Tehran over its disputed nuclear programme, but Beijing insisting more talks are the answer. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said Saturday that he hoped 2010 would not be "an unpeaceful year" for trade and economic relations with the United States. US and Chinese officials in Beijing did not immediately provide information about Steinberg's schedule.Overseas media have widely reported China's measures to maintain social and economic development, after the annual session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) opened Wednesday. The session outlined plans to keep the steady and fast development of economy, narrow the gap between city and country, and adjust income distribution pattern. The AP said that CPPCC National Committee Chairman Jia Qinglin said in a work report "2010 is a crucial year for China to respond to the impact of the global financial crisis and maintain steady and rapid economic development." The annual session of China's legislature, the National People's Congress (NPC), which opens Friday, was expected to "give a full airing to hot-button issues such as soaring real estate prices in many Chinese cities," it said. The Chinese government, which released a budget and work plan for the year, was expected to boost spending on education, pensions and medical care, continuing a push begun in the past decade to strengthen a tattered social safety net, it said. The annual plenary sessions of the NPC and the CPPCC National Committee are known as China's "two sessions." The AFP said China opened its annual parliamentary season Wednesday with a call from the Chinese leadership to keep up economic growth, maintain social stability and tackle a yawning urban-rural income gap. The two gatherings were the Chinese leadership's chance to showcase its efforts to tackle the key challenges facing the country, and economic concerns looked set to top that list, it said. Online, The Wall Street Journal Asia Edition said in an article the NPC's annual session would kick off Friday and this year's theme "naturally" was the economy. In a talk with China's netizens last week, Premier Wen Jiabao said "while it is the government's responsibility to expand the 'pie' of national wealth, it is the government's conscience to distribute it in an adequate manner," the article said. The Yonhap news agency said the Chinese government was speeding up its economic transformation after the global financial crisis because it realised it could not overcome future crises with its current economic structure dominated by cheap exports. China should keep a balanced development of service sectors and agriculture, and nurture the domestic market, it said. Economic transformation would be one of the hot topics of this year's NPC, it said. Yonhap said, although the Chinese economy was gradually recovering, China faced some serious problems, such as the widening urban-rural gap. China recently focused on migrant workers, eyeing the new generation of migrant workers born in the 1990s, and would discuss the making of the medium- and long- term layout for migrant workers. The Wall Street Journal said, while the 2009 NPC was obsessed with attaining an 8 percent growth rate, the priority for this year's session was to ensure a more equitable distribution of national income. A commentary on the website of Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao said that, from the perspective of China's economic development, it was in accordance with the needs of expanding China's consumption and transforming its economic growth mode for the country to gradually annul the dualistic structure between city and countryside, promote urbanization, scrap social welfare policies that discriminated against farmers, and ensure farmers' equal rights with urban dwellers. One of the major reasons for the long-term inequality between city and countryside was China didn't have a big enough "pie" to ensure the fair distribution of interests, it said. Canada's leading public policy magazine Policy Options said in a commentary that the Chinese leadership was paying more and more attention to the demands of the poor in remote regions. From the list of the central government's financial expenditures, it could be found that the government would heavily invest on infrastructure development and maintenance, medical reforms, poverty reduction and education, it said.South Korean President Lee Myung-bak held a meeting with Ghanaian Vice President Dramani Mahama Wednesday in which the two leaders agreed to enhance bilateral economic cooperation, especially in the area of oil and natural gas development, the presidential office said. "President Lee said the South Korean government will continue to increase its cooperation with Ghana and other African nations, while bolstering the two countries' joint efforts in oil and natural gas development," Cheong Wa Dae said in a statement. Lee also requested Ghana's support in helping South Korean firms participate in the construction of energy plants and infrastructure in the African country, as the Ghanaian leader said he hopes for South Korea's continued development aid for his country and shared expertise in economic growth, Lee's office said. Lee has been an ardent supporter of energy diplomacy as South Korea imports most of its energy and natural resources, and he's been actively seeking friendly relationships with the African region.The curtain was pulled back Tuesday on portions of a secret US cyber defense strategy crafted during the administration of former president George W. Bush. White House Internet security coordinator Howard Schmidt described bits of the strategy at the RSA cybersecurity conference here, saying the revelation was part of a promise of transparency by US President Barack Obama. Parts of a Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) declassified by Obama became available mid-day online at whitehouse.gov/cybersecurity. "We can't ask industry to help government and government can't help industry if we don't have transparency," Schmidt said while making the announcement. "It gives the American people the ability to partner with their government." Each of 12 initiatives in the plan are available for download. Schmidt said he hoped releasing declassified versions of the strategy would drive alliances between government cyber warriors and security firms, academics and others skilled in the field. "Our collective knowledge is out biggest strength," Schmidt said. "We will not beat our adversaries because they are weak; we will beat them because we become stronger." CNCI was crafted as the result of a presidential directive signed by Bush in January of 2008. Its budget remains a mystery but is estimated to be in the tens of billions of dollars.Results Friday from the Mexican Open, a $955,000 ATP World Tour event and a $220,000 WTA Tour event at the Fairmont Princess Hotel complex (seedings in parentheses): Singles Men Semifinals Juan Carlos Ferrero (4), Spain, def. Juan Monaco (7), Argentina, 7-5, retired. Women Semifinals Polona Hercog (8), Slovenia, def. Carla Suarez Navarro (5), Spain, 6-3, 7-5. Venus Williams (1), United States, def. Edina Gallovits, Romania, 6-4, 2-6, 6-2.BUENOS AIRES, Feb. 27 (Xinhua) - Argentine President Cristina Fernandez on Saturday offered her Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet "all the needed aid" for the 8.8- degrees earthquake that shook Chile on early Saturday morning. Bachelet thanked Fernandez' solidarity and said that once the damages are verified her government will be able to determine what and how many aid her country will need to recover. Meanwhile, Argentine ambassador in Santiago, Gines Gonzalez Garcia said that his country "will do all possible" to aid Chile. The earthquake jolted south Chile at 3:34 a.m. local time. The official death toll is now 85, though president-elect Sebastian Pinera said more than 120 have been killed.Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said he fully expected Wayne Rooney to score the winning goal in the League Cup final after the England striker headed the Red Devils to victory on Sunday. Rooney came off the substitutes' bench to hand United a 2-1 win over Aston Villa in the showpiece match at Wembley. Villa went ahead four minutes in after United defender Nemanja Vidic conceded a penalty, which James Milner scored. Michael Owen equalised before going off injured. His replacement Rooney headed the winner. "It was a bad start to the game. We got caught on the hop. The penalty kick, I think it was the right decision," said Ferguson. "But we recovered and that's the quality of Michael Owen. Unfortunately he's got a hamstring injury and had to come off and then Wayne comes on and scores a winning goal but the form he's been in, you expect that. "There's a lot of big games coming up now. It gives everyone a boost, no question about that."Olympic bronze medallist Joannie Rochette has revealed she is planning a Celine Dion-themed tribute to her mother who died just days before her podium finish in Vancouver during Saturday's figure skating gala. The gala, featuring all the Olympic figure skating medal winners including gold medallists Kim Yu-Na of South Korea and American Evan Lysacek, will take place in the Pacific Coliseum. Rochette, 24, said that she had decided to switch to a routine by her mother's favourite singer Dion, even before receiving a bouquet of flowers from the Quebec performer. "I have received Celine's flowers," said Rochette. "It's a strange coincidence because I had prepared my gala exhibition skate to Madonna's song 'Die Another Day.' "Even before hearing about Celine's flowers, I had decided to change my programme and skate to her song 'Vol' (Flight). "She sang it for her niece who died from cystic fibrosis. It touches me even more. My mother loved Celine Dion and she always sang along." Rochette said that she had already skated to the music in 2006 after learning that one of her training partners had been killed in a car accident just after she returned from the Turin Olympics. And Rochette, who earned the respect of the nation for her brave performance just four days after her 55-year-old mother Therese's death from a heart attack, said that the medal was as much her mom's as hers. "If she was with me I would have taken a picture of her with the medal round her neck," said the world silver medallist. "A big part of her life she devoted to me and I will always remember what she did for me. "Even if my (long) programme wasn't perfect, I was proud to have been myself, to have been the fighter my mother always taught me to be. "No matter what the outcome, I know I gave it everything and I'm proud to have done it, for me and for my mother." She admitted: "If someone had told me two years ago that I would be on an Olympic podium, I would have laughed at him. This is what my mother has given me for my career." Rochette added that she is planning to take a week off and then prepare to compete at the world championships in Turin next month.Cleveland center Shaquille O'Neal had surgery on his injured right thumb on Monday and will likely miss the remainder of the NBA regular season, the Cavaliers said. If he makes it back for the postseason, the NBA veteran is vowing to make up for lost time. "He feels like he let us down, but we understand injuries happen in the game," said teammate Jamario Moon, who got a text from the star center along with the other Cavs. "I think he's really down about being out. ... He let us know it's time to continue playing basketball and he's going to be all right." O'Neal was injured in the Cavaliers' NBA victory at Boston last Thursday, when a shot from him was blocked by Glen Davis in the first half. He was examined on Sunday by hand specialist Thomas Graham, who performed the surgery on Monday. The expected eight-week recovery time means O'Neal, who turns 38 on Saturday, might not be ready to play when the playoffs get underway on April 17. He was acquired by the Cavaliers last summer after Dwight Howard and Orlando eliminated Cleveland in the Eastern Conference finals. "Will be out for a min but when I return it is on," O'Neal posted on his Twitter account on Monday morning. "Win da ring for da king! Luv my team, Cavs baby!" Cleveland general manager Danny Ferry said O'Neal will wear a splint for a fortnight, then begin rehabilitation. "Our guys have done a very good job of stepping up this season. We are confident they will do the same in this situation," Ferry said.Olympic Games men's snowboard parallel giant slalom podium on Saturday: Gold: Jasey Jay Anderson (CAN) Silver: Benjamin Karl (AUT) Bronze: Mathieu Bozzetto (FRA)Sebastian Pinera, who is to take office as Chile's president on Thursday, met with Yin Weimin, China's human resources and social security minister, on Wednesday. Yin, who will represent China at Pinera's Thursday inauguration ceremony, told media he had a friendly meeting with Pinera, to whom he conveyed the warm greetings and best wishes from Chinese President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao. He also conveyed the deepest condolences and solidarity of the Chinese people and government "for the serious earthquake that this noble nation has suffered." He said that the two sides had reviewed "the steady development of friendly relations" over the past 40 years, and discussed how to further promote bilateral links. "We agreed on the need to further consolidate political links, to develop new economic and trade cooperation projects, and to make more effort in cultural exchange," Yin said. Pinera won the second round of presidential elections on Jan. 17, defeating former president Eduardo Frei. He will replace President Michelle Bachelet, who represents the same coalition as Frei, the Concertation. Chinese President Hu was among the first world leaders to express solidarity with Chile after the Feb. 27 8.8-magnitude earthquake that killed some 500 people and caused property damage worth millions of dollars. In his message, Hu also expressed China 's readiness to send aid to the South America nation for quake relief. Last week, China sent in an aircraft carrying 2 million dollars worth of aid material, including 700 tents, 10,000 blankets, 100 portable electricity generators and two water purification units. Trade between Chile and China reached over 17.4 billion dollars in 2009, thanks to a free trade agreement that came into force in 2006. China is Chile's largest trade partner and a main consumer of the country's copper exports.Mercedes GP is unlikely to win Formula One's season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix, according to team driver Michael Schumacher. "Maybe not," Schumacher said Friday when asked whether the former Brawn GP team could challenge from the March 14 opener. "At the moment we are not perfectly in the position we would like to be, to be competitive to win the first races straight away." The seven-time F1 champion, who is back after three years in retirement, said the pecking order was still developing with preseason testing ending at the Circuit de Catalunya on Sunday. Schumacher's lap time of 1 minute, 21.689 seconds was over a second behind leading driver Nico Hulkenberg of Williams. Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso, arguably the preseason favorite for the driver's title, was a second quicker than the 41-year-old German. "We're working hard, the season is long. The main issue is not to be far off," Schumacher said. "This is very difficult to judge right now, what is the real picture." Red Bull and McLaren are also expected to be front-runners, with Mark Webber setting the pace for Red Bull on Thursday. Schumacher said the car's pace -- which helped it win last year's driver and constructors' titles -- was improving as his time with the team grew. "We are working very good together. It has taken very little time to work with the team and to get on with everybody," Schumacher said. "Testing is one thing, racing is another thing." Former champion Lewis Hamilton expected Mercedes to be in the mix come Bahrain, although the McLaren driver wasn't ruling himself out for a win to open the season. "It's so hard to tell," Hamilton, the 2008 winner, said, "(but) I'm a positive guy so I'm going for it." Hamilton, who is joined by defending champion Jenson Button this season, said the British team was in a "much stronger" position than last year when a poor start left it too far behind to catch-up by the time it finally starting winning races. "It feels light years ahead of what it felt last year at this time," Hamilton said.Wang Meng and Zhou Yang of China advanced in the quarterfinals of women's 1,000-meter short track Friday, keeping both on track for a third gold medal at the Vancouver Olympics. Katherine Reutter of the United States also won her heat easily to move on to the semifinals. She's trying to win her first individual medal of the games after claiming a bronze in the relay. Apolo Anton Ohno of the United States hopped over a fallen skater to finish second in his quarterfinal heat of the men's 500, good enough to advance. He's already won a silver and a bronze at these games, giving him seven career medals -- more than any other short-track skater. Canada's Charles Hamelin and South Korea's Lee Ho-suk each moved on by winning their heats.Following are the results from the fifth day of the ATP Delray Beach International Tennis Championships here on Friday (prefix number denotes seeding): Quarterfinals Ernests Gulbis, Latvia, bt Leonardo Mayer, Argentina, 7-6(2), 6-4 Jarkko Nieminen, Finland, bt 3-Benjamin Becker, Germany, 7-5, 3-6, 7-6(5) 2-Ivo Karlovic, Croatia, bt 7-James Blake, United States, 6-3, 6-7(5), 6-1Three key senators are writing a new climate bill without a broad "cap-and-trade" approach to reducing carbon pollution, leaving behind what has been the central feature in the debate over climate legislation for years, The Washington Post reported Friday night. Cap and trade, in which overall pollution reduction targets are met by allowing facilities to buy and sell pollution credits, has become so politically unpopular that its Senate passage is viewed as unlikely. So Sens. John Kerry, a Democrat, Republican Lindsey Graham, and Independent Joe Lieberman are planning an alternative to be introduced next month, the Post reported on its Web site. The bill would apply different carbon controls to different sectors of the economy instead of taking a national approach. "This is a different bill," Lieberman told the Post. "We haven't abandoned the market-based idea, but we're willing to negotiate with colleagues who have different ideas." A cap-and-trade bill passed the House of Representatives last year in a close vote that some Democrats came to regret casting. It remains President Barack Obama's preferred approach as he pushes to cut the country's emissions by 17 percent by 2020 to meet internationally agreed upon goals. Opponents portray cap-and-trade as an energy tax in disguise and energy companies have been lobbying and advertising heavily against it. According to participants, Graham told environmental leaders in a meeting Wednesday that "cap-and-trade is dead," the Post said. The new bill by Kerry, Graham and Lieberman, who have taken lead roles in the climate debate, would apply different approaches to three major emission sources: electric utilities, transportation and industry, the Post said, attributing the details to unidentified people familiar with the process. Utilities would have to meet an overall emissions cap that would grow stricter over time. A carbon tax could be levied on motor fuel. And industrial facilities would be exempted from an emissions cap for several years, before it would be phased in. This more limited approach could pick up more votes in the Senate but even so would face a tough road with the Senate calendar crowded with health care legislation and other matters.Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey has undergone surgery after breaking his right leg in two places in his side's 3-1 Premier League victory at Stoke, the club announced on Sunday. The 19-year-old Wales international was stretchered off after being fouled by Stoke centre-back Ryan Shawcross in the second half of the game on Saturday. Shawcross was promptly sent off and left the field in tears. "During yesterdays match against Stoke City, Aaron Ramsey sustained fractures to the tibia and fibula in his right leg. Yesterday evening he underwent surgery," read a statement on the Arsenal website. "The operation successfully reduced the fractures and whilst it is too soon to state an exact timescale for recovery, Aaron will certainly miss the remainder of this season. "Our thoughts are with Aaron at this time and everyone at the club wishes him all the best in making as speedy a return to action as possible." Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, who saw Croatian striker Eduardo sustain a similar injury in a game at Birmingham in February 2008, said Shawcross's tackle was "not acceptable". But Shawcross was robustly defended by both his coach Tony Pulis and his team- mates and later released a statement expressing his sympathy. "There was absolutely no malice in the challenge," said the 22-year-old former Manchester United trainee, who received his first call-up to the England squad for next week's friendly with Egypt shortly after the game. "I would never go out to hurt a fellow professional. I am deeply upset that Aaron has suffered such a bad injury and my thoughts are with him. "I would like to send him my best wishes too for a speedy recovery." Ramsey, who joined Arsenal from Cardiff City in June 2008, has been withdrawn from the Wales squad to face Sweden in a friendly game in Swansea on Wednesday. He had made 29 appearances for Arsenal in all competitions this season, scoring four goals.The White House says President Barack Obama has spoken with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and German Chancellor Angela Merkel about the debt crisis in Greece. Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs says the topic came up during a video teleconference among the three leaders on Friday. Gibbs reiterated that the White House believes the European Union "can and will act appropriately" to ensure an effective response to the crisis in Greece. Obama, Brown and Merkel also discussed nuclear nonproliferation, Afghanistan, terrorism, the global economy and trade issues during the call.Collated results from the sixth day of the WTA Malaysian Open tournament on Saturday (x denotes seeding): Semi-finals Alisa Kleybanova (RUS x4) bt Ayumi Morita (JPN) 6-4, 6-1 Elena Dementieva (RUS x1) bt Sybille Bammer (AUT) 6-1, 6-3It didn't take long for the White House to name its next social secretary. Julianna Smoot, who was chief of staff to U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk, takes over at the White House for Desiree Rogers. Smoot was finance director for Barack Obama's presidential campaign. The White House said on Friday that Rogers, a longtime Chicago friend of the Obamas, was stepping down. That announcement came three months after an uninvited couple crashed the Obama administration's first state dinner. Rogers was criticized for her role in allowing the embarrassing episode to happen. The president says Smoot shares the Obamas' commitment "to creating an inclusive, dynamic and culturally vibrant White House."Following are the results from the fifth day of the ATP Delray Beach International Tennis Championships here on Friday (prefix number denotes seeding): Quarterfinals Ernests Gulbis, Latvia, bt Leonardo Mayer, Argentina, 7-6(2), 6-4 Jarkko Nieminen, Finland, bt 3-Benjamin Becker, Germany, 7-5, 3-6, 7-6(5) 2-Ivo Karlovic, Croatia, bt 7-James Blake, United States, 6-3, 6-7(5), 6-1Wang Meng and Zhou Yang of China advanced in the quarterfinals of women's 1,000-meter short track Friday, keeping both on track for a third gold medal at the Vancouver Olympics. Katherine Reutter of the United States also won her heat easily to move on to the semifinals. She's trying to win her first individual medal of the games after claiming a bronze in the relay. Apolo Anton Ohno of the United States hopped over a fallen skater to finish second in his quarterfinal heat of the men's 500, good enough to advance. He's already won a silver and a bronze at these games, giving him seven career medals -- more than any other short-track skater. Canada's Charles Hamelin and South Korea's Lee Ho-suk each moved on by winning their heats.Manchester City striker Craig Bellamy helped Wayne Bridge get revenge on John Terry then blasted the Chelsea captain after his side's 4-2 win at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Bridge refused to shake hands with Terry before kick-off as he made his feelings clear about the Chelsea defender's alleged affair with Vanessa Perroncel, the mother of the City left-back's young child. After opting to turn his back on England duty this week because he couldn't stand to be around Terry, Bridge could have been forgiven for savouring this result more than most. And Bellamy, who scored twice to dent Chelsea's title bid and lift City into fourth place in the Premier League, made his feelings about Terry clear after the match. Bellamy told Sky Sports 1: "You guys (the media) make a lot more of it you know. I know what JT is like and nothing surprises me about it, so I'm not going to comment on that. I think everybody in football knows what the guy is like, but that's off the field. "On it he's an outstanding player. He's a great captain for Chelsea. It's always going to be difficult when you play him and his team." After taunting Terry, Wales striker Bellamy admitted the result was a big boost for City's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League. "This was a big, big result for us because we have come away from the last month, we haven't been playing particularly well and it showed in the first half when we got going with the counter-attack with Carlos up there, especially on his own, which was difficult," he said. "I thought we got closer to him in the second half and we've got players that can score goals." City manager Roberto Mancini saluted Bridge, who was substituted in the closing stages, for producing another solid display despite the attention on him and also praised his team's spirit. He said: "Wayne Bridge has been playing well and this team has a fantastic spirit and for this reason we won this game. "It was a difficult game because Chelsea is a fantastic team and has played for many years in the Champions League."Jasey Jay Anderson of Canada won the men's parallel giant slalom snowboard gold medal at the Vancouver Olympic Winter Games at the Cypress Mountain on Satuday. Anderson beat Austrian Benjamin Karl in the two-run big final to claim the victory, and Mathieu bozzetto of France got the bronze.Canadian Charles Hamelin won the men's 500m short track speed skating gold medal at the Vancouver Olympic Winter Games here on Friday. South Korean Sung Si-Bak won the silver, and Francois-Louis tremblay of Canada finished third. American Apolo Anton Ohno was disqualified.Nicolien Sauerbreij of the Netherlands won the women's parallel giant slalom snowboard gold medal at the Vancouver Olympic Winter Games at the Cypress Mountain on Friday. Russian Ekaterina Ilyukhina got the silver, while Austrian Marion Kreiner had the bronze medal.Fabio Capello will tell his England stars their World Cup fate in a group meeting to unveil his 23-man squad for the finals in South Africa. England coach Capello will take a preliminary group of 30 players for a week of training in Austria leading up to a friendly against Japan on May 30 and the Italian will then gather his players to let them know if they have earned a place in the final squad. The England squads for the last two World Cups were announced publicly by Sven- Goran Eriksson, with the players finding out whether or not they were included through the media. But Capello is keen to let his players know their fate himself and he told The Mail On Sunday: "The last week we are training in Austria. Before the last game we play with Japan we have to decide. "There will be a meeting with all the players. I will speak with them together and say, 'Thank you very much but I have to choose'. "It's not the best moment for me. I would like all the players to be with me. They are very good players. "I hope to take 30 players to Austria but these are difficult moments, with the FA Cup final and the Champions League final at the same time. "At the moment I have 30 players in my mind, the last one was the centre-back Ryan Shawcross, as you know. These are the players from which I will choose the 23. "It will be during one meeting and after that we will speak to the media. I think it will be important for all the players to know my decision at once."Giuliano Razzoli won the men's Olympic slalom race Saturday, giving Italy its first gold medal in the last race of the Vancouver Games. Razzoli, who led after the first leg, won in a two-run combined time of 1 minute, 39.32 seconds. Ivica Kostelic of Croatia was 0.16 seconds back for his second silver medal of the games, and Andre Myhrer of Sweden earned bronze, 0.44 back. Defending Olympic champion Benjamin Raich of Austria was fourth, 0.05 off the podium, leaving the powerful men's team without an Alpine medal.Israel brought its campaign for new sanctions against Iran to the Chinese capital on Thursday, with the arrival of a high-level government delegation aiming to persuade Beijing to agree to the tougher punishment. Beijing has resisted a fourth round of U.N. Security Council sanctions against Iran following its recent announcement that it would press ahead with plans to increase its ability to make nuclear weapons. China -- which relies on Iran for energy supplies -- maintains now isn't the time to discuss such measures and the door to negotiations with Tehran remains open. As a permanent member of the Security Council, along with the U.S., Russia, Britain and France, China is in a position to veto any new measures. The Israeli delegation that included Deputy Prime Minister Moshe Yaalon and central bank chief Stanley Fischer did not answer questions from reporters as they left the Beijing airport Thursday afternoon. "They're coming to discuss a number of issues -- bilateral, regional and international -- of mutual interest to China and Israel, and among them the Iranian issue," Israeli Embassy spokesman Guy Kivetz said, declining to elaborate further. They were expected to meet with China's senior foreign policy adviser Dai Bingguo during the two-day visit. The United States and others fear Iran's nuclear program is geared toward making nuclear weapons, while Tehran claims it is simply to provide more power for its growing population. Iran has defied five U.N. Security Council resolutions -- and three sets of U.N. sanctions -- aimed at pressuring it to freeze enrichment, and has instead steadily expanded its program.The White House social secretary announced her resignation Friday, three months after coming under criticism over an incident in which a Washington couple gate- crashed a state dinner. Desiree Rogers, a close friend of President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle, told the Chicago Sun-Times she would step down in April after 14 months on the job. "As we turn the corner on the first year, this is a good time for me to explore opportunities in the corporate world," said Rogers, a graduate of Harvard Business School who came to Washington from Chicago, like the Obamas. There was no immediate confirmation of her decision from the White House. Rogers oversaw the organizations of hundreds of events since Obama took office in January 2009, including many that brought everyday Americans into the White House in a proclaimed effort to make government more open and transparent. But she may be more well known for a visit by two people who were not invited. Local area socialites Tareq Salahi and his wife Michaele managed to get past White House security and even shake hands with Obama during a state dinner given in honor of visiting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh last November. An angry Obama called the incident a "a screwup," and three Secret Service agents were disciplined. But the White House refused demands by opposition members of Congress to let Rogers testify at a hearing into the affair. The Salahis appeared at the hearing in January but cited their constitutional right to avoid self-incrimination and refused to testify. In her remarks to the Sun-Times, Rogers preferred to focus on the guests who came invited to the White House' "When I took on this assignment, we talked about the importance of creating the people's house. My work was really to create this framework," she said. "I think I completed that work. Our office has been able to lay the foundation for what will be known as the 'people's house' and it has already taken shape."Spanish coach Vicente del Bosque has denied that there is any friction with Rafael Benitez regarding the treatment of Fernando Torres. The Liverpool striker will be a key member of del Bosque's squad at the 2010 World Cup, but has been sidelined for much of this season with a knee injury. He returned after a six-week lay-off against Manchester City on Sunday and is expected to be included in del Bosque's squad to play France on March 3. "There's no truth in the fact that Benitez has complained - we have great relations with Liverpool," said the coach at FIFA's Team Workshop here. "We just want to take care of the player like his club does and make sure he arrives at the World Cup fully fit." The former Real Madrid boss also stated that he hopes rumours linking Cesc Fabregas with a return to Barcelona at the end of the season would be put on hold until the end of the World Cup. He said: "I just hope that nothing happens during the World Cup because we want him to concentrate on playing and not a transfer." Del Bosque led Spain to a record-breaking 35 matches unbeaten before that run was ended by the United States in the semi-finals of the Confederations Cup last year. The coach admitted that they had learnt from their mistakes and was confident they would benefit from the experience. "Last time was a good experience to come here and get used to our surroundings and the climate," he said. "The players learnt a lot and I think that will give us an advantage. The World Cup will be a momentous occasion for Africa and it will be a great experience for everyone." Another concern for Spain is the number of their squad who could be involved the latter stages of this season's Champions League. Barcelona, Real Madrid and Sevilla are all in the last 16 and despite Real's 1-0 defeat to Lyon last week, del Bosque revealed that he hoped all three could progress further. "It's good for Spanish football if they all do well and it doesn't really worry me about the World Cup because they will have time to recover," he said. "I hope that two of our teams do get to the final because it will mean they are ready to play at the top level for their country." But while his England counterpart Fabio Capello was bombarded with journalists' questions, the two times Champions League winner was largely ignored. Del Bosque was asked whether the furore surrounding the sacking of John Terry as captain would harm their chances of rivalling his team for the title. He said: "England are one of the favourites and they always will be. Every coach has an opinion and they do what they think is right. I'd prefer to talk about football."Seeing no prospect of a bipartisan agreement on health care, congressional Democrats said Friday that they would make another effort to pass sweeping health care legislation on their own. If anything, Democrats said, their seven-hour meeting with President Barack Obama and Republicans on Thursday confirmed their belief that it was futile to try to work with Republicans on a major health care bill because the philosophical differences between the parties were too profound. Accordingly, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, Democrats in the House and the Senate have begun work on a bill that they hope could be passed in the Senate by a simple majority. Under the tentative plan sketched by Pelosi and other Democrats, the House would pass the health care bill approved in December by the Senate, and both chambers would approve a separate package of changes using a parliamentary device known as budget reconciliation. The legislation would revise the Senate health bill to reflect compromises between House and Senate Democrats and suggestions by Obama. Democrats acknowledged that at the moment they did not have the votes for the reconciliation maneuver, which is intended to avoid the threat of a filibuster and the need for a 60-vote majority in the Senate. Democratic leaders said Republican intransigence could help them round up the votes of wavering centrists in their own caucus. Republicans adamantly oppose the health care bill, as well as the use of any parliamentary shortcuts. The White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said Friday that Obama would "make an announcement next week about the way forward" on health care. Gibbs declined to provide details. Democratic leaders hope that both chambers can complete action by March 26, when Congress is scheduled to begin its spring break. But, like many deadlines on this legislation, it could slip, leaving lawmakers to fight over health care in their midterm election campaigns. White House officials and their allies in liberal advocacy groups are making an all-out push to persuade Congress and the public that budget reconciliation is a legitimate procedure used often in the last 30 years to pass major legislation, including President Ronald Reagan's domestic agenda in 1981, an overhaul of welfare programs in 1996 and President George W. Bush's tax cuts in 2001 and 2003.New Formula One team Hispania Racing says Karun Chandhok will drive alongside Bruno Senna this season. The 26-year-old Indian driver raced in F1 feeder series GP2 and has been linked previously with a Force India seat. The announcement on Thursday came as owner Jose Ramon Carabante and team principal Colin Kolles unveiled the team's car livery. Kolles says Chandhok's arrival "will be great for the sport to have an Indian driver on the grid." The Spanish team, which was called Campos Meta until Wednesday, missed all of February's preseason testing but says it will be at the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix on March 14.Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd has abandoned the Obama administration's plan for a stand-alone consumer financial agency and is proposing a bureau in the Treasury Department, seeking to win Republican support for legislation to overhaul U.S. financial regulations. The Bureau of Financial Protection would be run by a director appointed by the president, have power to write consumer-protection rules for companies that offer financial services and be funded mainly through industry fees, according to a two-page summary the Connecticut Democrat is circulating. "It is one of several proposals he has advanced to seek a bipartisan consensus and enhance consumer protection," Dodd spokeswoman Kirstin Brost said Saturday in an e-mail. "We do not have an agreement." Dodd's proposal is aimed at breaking a deadlock with Republicans, who oppose the independent Consumer Financial Protection Agency sought by President Barack Obama in his June financial regulations proposal. The disagreement has stalled Senate negotiations on the overall financial regulatory bill. Dodd, in a Bloomberg Television interview Saturday, said negotiators were "close" to a deal on the legislation and declined to set a date for releasing the measure. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., had been negotiating with Dodd on the legislation. The proposed Treasury bureau would have examination and enforcement authority over large banks and credit unions, as well as nonbank mortgage companies. Banking regulators would retain such power for banks and credit unions with less than $10 billion in assets. The bureau would be funded by fees paid by large banks and nonbanks, with the Federal Reserve making up any shortfall. Dodd's proposal also limits the powers of state regulators to enforce consumer rules at national banks, adopting language from the regulatory overhaul bill the House passed in December. The Dodd proposal might strip the Fed of powers to regulate state-chartered banks, while letting the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. retain its role over such lenders. Dodd in November proposed eliminating the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision and folding their powers into a Financial Institutions Regulatory Administration, which he said would take over the bank oversight powers of the Fed and FDIC.Marie-Philip Poulin scored two goals, Shannon Szabados made 28 saves, and Canada rolled through the United States 2-0 Thursday to win the women's hockey gold medal for a third straight Olympics. In front of a raucous Vancouver crowd ringing cowbells and frantically waving thousands of maple leaf flags, Canada thrived on its home fans' relentless cheers. The Canadians dominated every aspect of the biggest game in this young sport, earning their 15th straight Olympic victory. Playing with a consistency and passion its men's team can only hope to emulate this weekend, Canada hasn't lost at the Olympics since 1998, when the Americans won their sport's first gold. The Canadians got two first-period goals from Poulin, the super-speedy 18-year-old Quebecois forward who claims she feels no Olympic pressure. Their smooth, graceful goalie did the rest, with Szabados capping her first Olympics with flawless netminding in a win that sometimes seemed just as one-sided as Canada's 18-0 victory over Slovakia to open the Winter Games 12 days ago. The Canadians kept nearly the entire game in the Americans' end -- outpassing, outshooting and simply outworking the only team in women's hockey with a chance of standing up to them. Much of the Canadian men's team, which faces Slovakia in the semifinals Friday, watched the game from press box seats above the ice, while hockey great Wayne Gretzky and several Canadian gold medalists from other sports were in the stands. Several members of the American men's team also attended before their meeting with Finland. When the puck went to center ice and time expired, the Canadians skated into a massive pile-up near their goal. Cheering fans threw several flags to the players, and they raised the banners or wrapped them around their shoulders as capes. Jessie Vetter made 27 saves for the Americans, whose offensive potency evaporated in front of Szabados and the Canadian defense. The potent power play that scored 13 goals in the last four games went 0-for-6, and the Canadians consistently won most of the battles in a physical, grinding game. The only matchup that matters in women's hockey was secured in Monday's semifinals, when the Americans routed Sweden and Canada clobbered Finland to finish two dominant runs through the field.Maria Riesch of Germany won the Olympic slalom title Friday for her second gold medal of the games. Riesch led after the first leg and won with a two-run combined time of 1 minute, 42.89 seconds through the snow and fog. Marlies Schild of Austria was 0.43 second back to take silver, and Sarka Zahrobska of the Czech Republic trailed by 1.01 to earn bronze. Germany has won three of the five women's Alpine races after Riesch took the super-combined and Viktoria Rebensburg earned gold in the giant slalom on Thursday. Downhill champion Lindsey Vonn of the United States straddled a gate early in her first run.Italy will stay in Afghanistan and strengthen its peace-keeping efforts there even though an Italian embassy official was killed in a Taliban attack in Kabul, Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said Friday. "Italy and the other (United States') allies will remain committed to Afghanistan," Frattini told state television Rai. The victim was identified as Pietro Antonio Colazzo, a diplomatic advisor in Italian embassy in Kabul. He was allegedly a member of Italy's foreign intelligence agency, according to the ANSA news agency. Defense Minister Ignazio La Russa said Colazzo was "a man who was working in a dangerous land with courage and dedication to improve the Afghan people's living conditions." At least 17 people were killed Friday in Taliban suicide bombing attacks on three hotels. Colazzo was reportedly on the phone to Afghan police when he was cut down in a firefight following one of the bombs. Colazzo's death brings Italy's death toll in Afghanistan to 22 since 2004. Despite frequent opposition calls for a rapid withdrawal from Afghanistan, the center-right government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has committed itself to supporting U.S. President Barack Obama's new Afghan strategy focused on a surge against the Taliban. Italy will send an additional 1,000 troops by the end of the year and has been active in seeking political solutions to the conflict.Spanish coach Vicente del Bosque has denied that there is any friction with Rafael Benitez regarding the treatment of Fernando Torres.

Although McGregor's injuries were not disclosed from Saturday's attack, there were reports Monday he needed treatment at a hospital for an eye problem. Police are investigating the assault. The incident may also prevent him returning to the Scotland team for the first time since being involved in an all-night drinking session a year ago. The Scots play the Czech Republic on March 3 in Glasgow. Scotland coach Craig Levein said Monday that Rangers manager Walter Smith had told him McGregor was in doubt to play Celtic.Iran has arrested a group of hardline Sunnis suspected of killing a prayer leader and a bank guard in the northwestern province of West Azerbaijan, Mehr new agency reported on Saturday. "An extremist group which carried out several assassinations by infiltrating religious centres and misusing the religious zeal of youngsters has been arrested," Mehr said quoting an intelligence ministry statement. "The group has Wahhabist tendencies and has killed a bank guard and a Sunni religious leader in the city of Mahabad around a year ago." Wahhabism is the ultra-conservative form of Sunni Islam practised in Saudi Arabia. The group was planning to carry out other attacks and a number of weapons were seized from its members, the report said without giving any more details about the group or number of people arrested. In September 2008, unidentified gunmen assassinated a Sunni Muslim prayer leader, Haj Mamousta Molla Abdolrahim Tina, in the West Azerbaijan city of Mahabad. The group's arrest comes just days after Iran declared it had captured its most wanted Sunni militant, Abdolmalek Rigi, who heads the rebel Jundallah (Soldiers of God). The Jundallah group has been waging a deadly insurgency in the southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan against the Shiite rule of Iran.A suicide bomber struck near the government headquarters in the capital of Iraq's Anbar province on Thursday, the latest in what Iraqi and U.S. officials warned would be a wave of violence before next month's parliamentary elections. The attack -- in Ramadi, an overwhelmingly Sunni city -- occurred amid heightened sectarian tensions and came only days after insurgents vowed to disrupt the elections. There have been a series of attacks already this month, many of them with an added political undercurrent. At least two candidates have been killed. Bombings have struck at least four party headquarters in Baghdad, as well as a candidate's home in Ramadi. In Maysan, in southern Iraq, gunmen opened fire on a candidate hanging posters for Ahrar, a party led by a cleric who favors a secular democracy, killing one of the candidate's aides, the party said on Thursday. The brother of a Shiite Turkman candidate in Kirkuk was seized -- kidnapped, his family said -- under disputed circumstances early on Thursday, inflaming ethnic tensions in that disputed northern province between one of the main Shiite coalitions and Kurdish security forces. Thursday's attack in Anbar, the deadliest since the campaign officially began last week, killed at least 13 people and wounded more than two dozen, according to the police and hospital officials. A bomber wearing a vest or belt of explosives appeared to make a target of the government compound in Ramadi that includes the region's provincial council, the governor's office and the police headquarters, the officials said. The blast occurred at a heavily fortified entrance to the compound, near a restaurant and an office of the Awakening group, former insurgents who joined with U.S. and Iraqi forces in 2007 to fight al-Qaida in Mesopotamia and other insurgents. Many members of the group remain at odds with the government of Prime Minister Nouri Kamal al-Maliki for failing to provide permanent jobs, as promised. "Al-Qaida is trying to paralyze the elections," the provincial police chief, Maj. Gen. Beha al-Karkhi, said in an interview, "but we will not allow them to do so." Al-Karkhi took over as police chief after twin suicide bombings in December killed two dozen and wounded dozens more, including the governor. That attack led to the firing of his predecessor as police chief. Last week, the Islamic State of Iraq, the insurgent group that includes the remnants of al-Qaida in Mesopotamia here, warned in an audio recording that it would try to prevent the elections from happening, saying the vote was a plot by the country's Shiite majority to repress Sunnis. "We are setting the state for military, media and psychological preparation in response to the droll and dangerous theatrical play, called parliamentary elections," the recording, attributed to a figure known as Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, warned, according to a translation by the SITE Intelligence Group. "O people, these elections are illicit in the legislation of our Lord." Iraq's election campaign, long expected to be fiercely contested, has been disturbed by the disqualification of hundreds of candidates on the grounds they once belonged to or remained sympathetic to the Baath Party that ruled Iraq under Saddam Hussein. The disqualified candidates were Sunnis and Shiites -- most of them challengers to the main Shiite coalitions, including that of al-Maliki. But many Sunnis complained that the government was disenfranchising them and discrediting the elections even before they could be held. Anbar, once the heartland of the Sunni-led insurgency, had become so stable that most U.S. forces left. But these recent attacks have alarmed Iraqi and U.S. commanders who fear that the region could again become a terrorist foothold. In addition to the latest bombings at the government headquarters in Ramadi, twin bombings in October killed 26 people and wounded 65 at a reconciliation meeting in Ramadi attended by government officials, tribal leaders and security commanders. Khari Abdul Hadi, an aide to Anbar's governor, said in a telephone interview from Ramadi on Thursday that the roots of the violence began in politics and reached even deeper. He expressed resignation bordering on despair. "Whenever there is a political conflict, explosions happen," Hadi said. Then, referring to those behind the latest attack, he added: "I cannot blame the explosion on anyone because there are so many. We are lost. We don't know our enemy."Guus Hiddink will leave as coach of Russia's national team when his contract expires on June 30, raising the prospect of him taking a job, with a number of suitors at club and national level. Hiddink guided Russia to the semifinals of the 2008 European Championships but the team fell short of qualifying for this year's World Cup. Hiddink wrote in a Dutch newspaper column that he had spoken with new Russian federation president Sergei Fursenko and "it was decided that we will part ways after the expiration of my contract on June 30." "We decided this now in order to give the federation enough time to look for a successor," he wrote in De Telegraaf. The Russian Football Union said the move was Hiddink's decision. "Guus Hiddink took this difficult decision independently, and we are respectful of his choice," it said in a Web site statement, confirming the 63-year-old Dutchman will see his contract through. Hiddink garnered praise among Russia's success-starved football fans for making the national side, so often a target for humor, difficult to beat. However, hopes of further progress were dashed by a surprise defeat to Slovenia in the 2010 World Cup qualifying playoffs in November. Hiddink did not mention future plans but has been linked with major clubs in Europe and even with taking up a job at short notice coaching one of the teams at the World Cup. Hiddink was reportedly in the running for jobs at Juventus and Liverpool, while he also has close links to Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich and coached the team on an interim basis last season, winning England's F.A. Cup. There had also been reports that Hiddink was being lined up by Nigeria to lead the team at the World Cup. He has previously coached clubs such as Real Madrid and PSV Eindhoven, and national teams including the Netherlands, South Korea and Australia. Russia's sports minister Vitaly Mutko said earlier this week -- before Hiddink announced he would not renew his contract -- that the country needed a homegrown coach. Mutko's main achievement in his previous job as head of the Russian Football Union was landing Hiddink in April 2006. ------ AP writer David Nowak contributed to this report from Moscow.Results from the fourth day of the WTA Malaysian Open tournament on Thursday (x denotes seeding): 2nd rd: Sybille Bammer (AUT x6) bt Akgul Amanmuradova (UZB) 6-3, 6-0 Chanelle Scheepers (RSA) bt Tatjana Malek (GER) 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 Magdalena Rybarikova (SVK x7) bt Noppawan Lertcheewakarn (THA) 6-4, 7-5Democratic leaders in Congress unveiled proposals Thursday that would limit the impact of a Supreme Court decision allowing unfettered corporate spending on political campaigns. Sen. Charles Schumer (N.Y.) and Rep. Chris Van Hollen (Md.) called for a ban on companies with more than 20 percent foreign ownership, government contractors and bank bailout recipients from participating in U.S. elections. They also want to require companies to inform shareholders about political spending, and to mandate that corporate chief executives to appear in any political advertising funded by their companies. Schumer told reporters that the proposals will be introduced later this month. "If we don't act quickly, the court's ruling will have an immediate and disastrous impact on the 2010 elections," said Schumer, the third-ranking Democrat in the Senate. Other measures in the package outlined by Schumer and Van Hollen: _Corporations would be banned from spending money on U.S. elections if a majority of their board of directors are foreign nationals, or if their U.S. operations fall under the direction of a foreign entity or country. Such measures would mark a significant strengthening of current limits on foreign influence in U.S. elections. "I think every American would agree that we do not want foreign interest spending money to try to affect those outcomes," said Van Hollen, who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. _ Additional disclosures would be required for companies that help sponsor political advertising. The Democratic lawmakers said they are still considering whether to demand shareholder approval for campaign spending. _Unions, advocacy groups and all corporations, including nonprofits, would be required to set up special accounts for spending on "political activities" and would be required to report contributions and spending details to the Federal Election Commission. Several of the proposals are aimed at preventing corporations from hiding behind trade groups or other organizations in order to fund attack ads on political candidates, backers said. During the health-care debate, for example, several major insurers that publicly expressed support for reform gave up to $20 million to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to pay for anti-reform advertising. "Any funneling of resources by a particular company to the Chamber of Commerce or a professional association will not avoid detection," Schumer said. The ideas drew immediate praise from many campaign-finance activists, who argue that the high court's ruling last month will launch a tidal wave of corporate and union money into U.S. elections, including from companies with primary ownership overseas. "The reforms outlined today ... are needed to blunt the worst impacts of this heinous judicial overreach by the court," said Lisa Gilbert, democracy advocate for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. But the proposals are certain to be strongly opposed by major business groups and many Republicans, who have praised the court's decision as a victory for the First Amendment. In a 5 to 4 decision Jan. 21, the high court found that corporations have the same rights as individuals when it comes to political speech and can therefore use their profits to support or oppose individual candidates. The decision opens the door to unlimited spending by corporations, trade groups and unions in the weeks leading up to an election. Corporations had been banned since 1947 from using company money in this way. But they remain barred from using corporate treasuries to make direct donations to candidates. Those contributions must still be made through political action committees, which raise money independently. The court's decision has come under sharp criticism from Democrats, who historically have attracted less campaign money from corporations than Republicans. During his State of the Union address, President Obama said the ruling would "open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections." Many Republicans and conservative campaign experts, by contrast, argue that Democrats are overstating the ruling's potential impact and are attempting to demonize corporations in the process. Justice Samuel A. Alito, who sided with the court's majority, mouthed the words "not true" in response to Obama.President Barack Obama ended an extraordinary live-on-TV summit on health care overhaul Thursday with the bleak assessment that accord between Democrats and Republicans on his top domestic priority may not be possible. He rejected Republican preferences for starting from scratch, discussing the issue much longer or taking a step-by-step solution, and instead suggested that Democrats will try to pass a sweeping overhaul without Republican support. "We cannot have another yearlong debate about this," Obama said at the end of a 7 1/2-hour marathon policy debate. Obama and other Democrats argued that a broad overhaul is imperative for the country's future economic vitality. The president cast health care as "one of the biggest drags on our economy," tying it to an issue that's even more pressing to many Americans. Though there was much talk of agreement, each side held onto long-entrenched positions that left them far apart. Democrats seek a kind of broad remake; Republicans favor much more modest changes. "We just can't afford this. That's the ultimate problem," said Rep. Eric Cantor, the No. 2 House Republican. Passing a version of the bill that Republicans have so far managed to block despite solid Democratic majorities in Congress is critical to the president's political future and that of his party ahead of congressional elections in November. At stake is the Democrats' stalemated legislation to extend coverage to more than 30 million people who are now uninsured. Polls show Americans want their elected leaders to address the problems of high medical costs, eroding access to coverage and uneven quality. But the public is split over the Democrats' sweeping legislation, with its $1 trillion, 10-year price tag and many complex provisions, including some that wouldn't take effect for another eight years -- after Obama has packed up and left the White House. But neither side gave ground throughout on Thursday, sticking mostly to familiar arguments and talking points. The president urged Republicans to "do a little soul searching" and said majority Democrats would decide quickly how to proceed on the issue that has eluded leaders for half a century. Both chambers of Congress passed separate bills last year. But before the two versions could be reconciled, Republicans captured the Massachusetts Senate seat in a special election to replace the late Edward M. Kennedy. That cost Democrats the 60-vote supermajority needed to overcome Republican procedural obstacles and pass major legislation. Public skepticism about the health care plan was seen as contributing to the Republican victory in Massachusetts, an overwhelmingly Democratic state. Despite losing their supermajority, Democrats can still pass major health legislation by using special budget rules that require only a simple majority. They have been reluctant to use that process so far because it would enrage Republicans and likely further worsen the partisan divide. Obama lamented the partisan bickering that has stalled the legislation. "Politics I think ended up trumping practical common sense," he said. But, he noted, "everybody here understands the desperation that people feel when they're sick. And I think everybody here is profoundly sympathetic and wants to make sure that we have a system that works for all Americans." And yet, even as he pleaded for cooperation he acknowledged early on in the summit that agreement may not be possible. "I don't know that those gaps can be bridged," Obama said. "If not, at least we will have better clarified for the American people what the debate is all about." Disagreements were not always expressed diplomatically on Thursday. The forum at one point yielded a testy exchange between the president and his former opponent Sen. John McCain, who complained that Obama reneged on a campaign promise to bring change to Washington for encouraging health care dealmaking behind close doors. "We're not campaigning any more. The election is over," Obama snapped, prompting the Republican to retort that he's "reminded of that every day." Many lawmakers and Obama also stressed areas of agreement, including items such as allowing parents to keep young adult children on their health plans into their 20s, and ensuring that sick people aren't dropped by insurance companies. But such items occupy the edges of reform. The summit was held at Blair House, the elegant presidential guest quarters across the street from the White House. Leaders of both parties spoke, with Obama steering the debate as moderator.Former top-ranked player Ana Ivanovic has hired Steffi Graf's old coach, Heinz Gunthardt, to try end her slump in form. Ivanovic said on her Web site Monday that Gunthardt, who helped Graf win 12 Grand Slam titles, will accompany her to the BNP Paribas Showdown in New York next week. Ivanovic has replaced the injured Serena Williams in the exhibition event. Ivanovic has fallen from No. 1 in the rankings in 2008, when she won the French Open, to No. 23 and was knocked out in the second round of the Australian Open last month.DaMarcus Beasley says more than a solid performance in the American attack Wednesday is needed for him to earn a spot on the U.S. World Cup squad. Beasley entered in the 34th minute of a 2-1 loss to the Netherlands after Stuart Holden injured a shin. Beasley's long free kick was headed in by U.S. captain Carlos Bocanegra for the American goal in the 88th minute. "It feels good to be back," Beasley said after his first match with the national team since his blunder led to a Brazilian goal in the Confederations Cup last June 18. "I need more games, and then I will try make things difficult for the coach." After scoring twice in five games in December for Glasgow Rangers, Beasley was sidelined for two months with a thigh injury. The first match back for the 27-year-old midfielder was Feb. 14. "My form is the most important thing," he said. "I need to work on that, and then we will see." This was the last game for the national team before U.S. coach Bob Bradley picks his 23-man World Cup roster. Beasley, a Fort Wayne, Ind., native, was part of the 2002 and 2006 World Cup teams and has 17 goals in 90 international appearances. "We have a little more time where we're sizing up form and assessing injuries, but certainly there is a nucleus of guys," Bradley said. "There are always going to be tough decisions." Bradley praised Beasley, who had a chance to tie the score in the 90th minute. His free kick was saved by goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg at the far post.Outgoing Philippine President Gloria Arroyo on Wednesday defended her economic achievements during nine years in power, amid criticism that poverty levels had not improved and her government was corrupt. Arroyo, who is constitutionally mandated to step down on June 30, insisted she had transformed the country once described as one of the region's weakest to one that is now steadily attracting foreign investors. "The future for the Philippine economy is indeed much brighter now than it was in 2001," Arroyo told businessmen in a briefing attended by her economic managers. "Our economy has doubled over the last nine years, and we are back on the radar screen of international investors." However, she acknowledged her successor faced many challenges on the economic front. "Capitalising on our potential will only be possible if we continue to have leadership willing to make the tough and often unpopular decisions that are required to break the hold of entrenched special interest and keep our economy moving," she said. The Philippines goes to the polls in May to choose a new president, but Arroyo's chosen successor, former defence chief Gilberto Teodoro, has been doing extremely poorly in surveys. In defending her government's economic record, Arroyo said inflation in the last quarter of 2009 had dropped to 2.9 percent while external debt as a percentage of gross domestic product had been cut in half to 34 percent. She said the unemployment rate was down from double digits in 2001 to 7.5 percent currently, and more than eight million jobs, mostly in the agriculture sector, had been created. Foreign direct investments had grown significantly, while total public sector debt, which once was bigger than GDP, had been cut to about 72 percent, according to Arroyo. "Those are real numbers. They are making a positive impact on the lives of the real people," she said. Arroyo, who was swept into power by a 2001 popular revolt that ousted graft tainted Joseph Estrada, has been largely credited by analysts for bringing economic stability to the country. However, the World Bank said last month that average economic growth of almost five percent in the Philippines over the past decade had not made a serious dent in tackling the enormous poverty plaguing the country. Her rule has also been marked by three coup attempts, claims she sought to rig the 2004 presidential election, as well as allegations of massive corruption involving members of her family and government officials. Speaking at the same economic forum as Arroyo, Finance Secretary Margarito Teves said the country's budget deficit was forecast to fall to 293.2 billion pesos (6.37 billion dollars), or 3.6 percent of GDP, in 2010. Teves said that tax and customs collections in the first two months of this year had been better than expected and this would lead to a lower deficit than the 298.5 billion pesos posted last year.China won the women's 3,000-meter relay short track speedskating final after four-time defending champion South Korea was disqualified. The South Koreans crossed the finish line first Wednesday night, but after several minutes of discussion among the referees, they were disqualified. South Korea was seeking a record fifth consecutive gold medal in the event. China's team of Sun Linlin, Wang Meng, Zhang Hui and Zhou Yang leaped in joy when they were announced as Olympic champions. Canada earned the silver, and the United States took the bronze in the four-team final.Germany consolidated their place atop the Olympic Games medal table on Thursday thanks to the gold won by Viktoria Rebensburg in the women's giant slalom, her country's first in the event for 54 years. The 20-year-old Olympic debutant sprung a huge surprise to upset the field and win the weather-affected event ahead of Slovenia's Tina Maze and overnight leader Elisabeth Goergl of Austria. "I have had a look at the medal table," said Rebensburg, whose previous best finish on the elite World Cup circuit was a second in this season's giant slalom in Cortina. "I'm happy to have contributed a medal to that. It's cool - pretty awesome," she said. Germany, with an overall haul of 28 from eight gold, 10 silver and seven bronze, now stand clear of both the US and Canadian teams, who have won seven golds apiece. Rebensburg overshadowed better known team-mates Maria Riesch, who last week won super-combined gold, and Kathrin Hoelzl, the leader of World Cup giant slalom standings. "She should experience this moment, right now in this moment," Riesch said of Rebensburg. "Because it all goes by like a film and tonight she will shake her head and wonder what happened." Rebensburg, a former world junior champion, admitted that she had been under less stress than her team-mates and rivals. "I don't think I had as much pressure as the top three but I know I can ski fast and win a race, so I made my own pressure. "I was able to accelerate in the last part. If you don't take any risks, you won't win anything. "I was able to show I could do it with the podium in Cortina. Everything just came together here. It's just fabulous to get a medal. "It's unbelievable," said the German. "I don't know what to say. It just sounds so strange. "It's going to take a few days to sink in. I just want to enjoy the ceremony and the rest of the day. We'll celebrate tonight. Silver medallist Maze became the first Slovenian to win two Olympic medals after also claiming a silver in the super-G. "Yeah, I did want gold," acknowledged Maze, who missed out by just four- hundredths of a second. "It was my wish today, but still it is a silver medal and I won two medals in this Olympics. It's a big deal. It's a big day for me." Goergl added bronze to her third-placed effort in the downhill, but refused to rise to the bait on why her male team-mates were failing to bother the medal engravers. "Ask the guys," she said. "You're asking me questions I cannot explain!"Maria Riesch of Germany led the first run of the woman's slalom Friday, and Lindsey Vonn skied out in her final Olympic race. Riesch finished in 50.75 seconds through steady falling snow as her best friend and big rival Vonn went out in the top half. Vonn straddled a gate when she could not correct her line after her right ski slid away coming out of a left-hand turn. Sarka Zahrobska of the Czech Republic was second, 0.40 behind, and Marlies Schild of Austria trailed Riesch by 0.65 in third. Riesch won super-combined gold and leads the World Cup slalom standings. Her younger sister Susanne was fourth, with 0.71 to make up in the afternoon second leg.German Olympic debutant Viktoria Rebensburg sprung a huge surprise Thursday to upset the field and win the women's giant slalom, ahead of Slovenia's Tina Maze and Austrian Elisabeth Goergl. Rebensburg clocked a total combined time of 2min 27.11sec over the two runs, the second of which was held over to Thursday because of bad weather, 0.04sec ahead of Maze with Goergl a further 0.10sec adrift. "It's unbelievable," said the German, whose previous best finish on the elite World Cup circuit was a second in this season's giant slalom in Cortina. "It's going to take a few days to sink in. I just want to enjoy the ceremony and the rest of the day. We'll celebrate tonight. "I don't think I had as much pressure as the top three but I know I can ski fast and win a race, so I made my own pressure." Maze added a further medal to her super-G silver and said she was relieved to have finally put together some good performances on the world stage. "It's great," the Slovenian said. "When I arrived here I knew I was a strong racer but I didn't expect to take two medals because I was never racing well at big events. "The conditions were better today, a little soft but the same for everyone. It was a good but difficult race." With the Austrian men medal-less and just Saturday's slalom to go, Goergl was again left flying her country's flag, picking up bronze to go with her third- placed finish in the downhill. The overnight leader said she had given everything but the "conditions were a little softer than I expected". "I lost gold but won bronze. It was so close," she said. "It was a good challenge to get back into race mood (after the hold over). It was a good experience and good practice." Wednesday's first run was overshadowed by American speed queen Lindsey Vonn crashing out and breaking a finger bone. In thick snow, team-mate Julia Mancuso's run immediately after Vonn was brought to a halt and the double silver medallist was forced to start again. Mancuso, the defending Olympic champion in the discipline, eventually finished 1.30sec off Goergl, and despite a fast second run could only end in eighth at 0.55sec. "For sure I was bummed out by it, but it was out of my control," Mancuso said of the yellow flag on Wednesday. "I just had to hang in there and stay in the game, show I was ready to do it. "It sucks but sometimes that happens in life." Mancuso was also quick to play down talk of a feud between her and Vonn. "I really think it's been taken a little out of proportion," she said of an interview she gave to Sports Illustrated in which she said the media attention Vonn received upset the US team's dynamic. "Of course she deserves the attention, she's the best US skier we've ever had. "We're both very different and have both got to these Games and got medals in opposite ways. It's always good to see a fellow American on the podium."Russian laws must be changed to keep corrupt police from extorting money from businessmen and to allow suspects in economic crimes to be released on bail instead of being jailed, President Dmitry Medvedev said Friday. The comments, made to a meeting of business leaders, marked a strikingly candid recognition that Russia's endemic police corruption is raising public anger. Opposition groups and rights activists have planned a rally Sunday to demand an overhaul of the police force. Medvedev told the meeting he would be submitting a bill on such issues to parliament soon. "I hope it will allow to at least partly bar corrupt law enforcement officials from using jailings in their attacks on business," he said. "We all know of many such examples: They would put people in prison at a competitor's behest, and then would charge money to set them free. It's time to end such abuses." The statement also underlined Medvedev's efforts to cast himself as more liberal than his predecessor and mentor, Vladimir Putin. Medvedev has promised to create a more tolerant environment for business and to expand political freedoms, but critics say that he has accomplished little so far because Putin has continued calling the shots as Russia's powerful prime minister. Medvedev signed a law in December banning the jailing of people suspected of tax crimes and allowing those convicted of a first tax offense to be fined without being held criminally liable. He also fired 20 senior Federal Penitentiary Service officials, including the Moscow prisons chief and the head of the jail where 37-year-old tax lawyer Sergei Magnitsky died of an untreated illness in November. Magnitsky's death caused a public uproar. Magnitsky was arrested in November 2008 on tax-evasion charges linked to his work with a British investor who was barred from Russia. The president followed up last week by firing more than a dozen top police officials and slashing thousands of jobs in the most radical Interior Ministry shake-up since Medvedev came to power in 2008. The Russian public has become increasingly indignant about rampant police corruption and other abuses. Human rights groups say officers routinely use trumped-up charges, torture and blackmail. Numerous incidents of violence, including an April supermarket shooting spree in which a Moscow police precinct chief killed two people and wounded seven, have put pressure on the Kremlin to act.Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand will miss Sunday's League Cup final against Aston Villa due to a back injury. Ferdinand's injury stopped him taking part in United's 3-0 league win over West Ham at Old Trafford on Tuesday and boss Sir Alex Ferguson confirmed the England captain won't be fit in time for this weekend's match at Wembley. "He felt a twinge in his back this morning (Tuesday) when we did a warm-up at (United's training ground) Carrington. We can't take any chances. He won't be playing on Sunday," Ferguson told Sky Sports News. The former Leeds star has played just three times in 2010 as a result of injury and suspension. Ferdinand's injury also casts doubt over his ability to play in England's friendly against Egypt at Wembley on March 3, which was due to be his first international outing since replacing John Terry as England captain.Viktor Yanukovych was inaugurated as Ukraine's president Thursday, five years after his first bid failed amid massive protests over vote fraud. Yanukovych took the oath of office in the Verkhovna Rada, the Ukrainian parliament that has been the scene of intense maneuvering over the future of his rival Yulia Tymoshenko, who aims to stay on as prime minister. Yanukovych narrowly defeated Tymoshenko in presidential elections Feb. 7. Tymoshenko alleges vote fraud, but she has dropped a court case on the claims. Tymoshenko led the 2004 Orange Revolution protests that paved the way for a rerun of a presidential election in which Yanukovych had been declared winner. He lost the repeated vote to Viktor Yushchenko. Yanukovych enters office with a shaky mandate, inheriting an economy crippled by the global financial crisis and a nation whose political loyalties are deeply divided. He has broad support in the Russian-speaking east of the country, but in the Ukrainian-speaking west, he lost in virtually every region to Tymoshenko. Her refusal to concede defeat and step down from the premiership threatens to prolong the kind of political wrangling that has paralyzed Ukraine's government for several years, deepening the financial crisis that shrank the economy by 15 percent last year. The parliament has not even been able to pass a budget for this year. Weeks of negotiations in the back rooms of parliament have failed to produce a coalition against Tymoshenko. On the eve of Yanukovych's inauguration, she appeared to taunt his Party of Regions for this failure, challenging its leadership to oust her if they could. "The Party of Regions does not have the votes to carry out this dismissal," Tymoshenko told a government meeting Wednesday, appearing in a stark red dress instead of the soft tones she is known for wearing. The deputy head of Yanukovych's party, Anna German, said Yanukovych would never be able to work in tandem with Tymoshenko and would seek to replace her by this spring.The Fendi label and designer Karl Lagerfeld have been holding fashion hands for over four decades, creating a unique marriage of fur and flare. In 1965, the label's five founding sisters, known for their fur workmanship, hauled the eccentric German designer on board to jazz up the staid image of the traditional fur coat. The result was a steady stream of new ways to work and wear furs, resorting to turning a coat inside out -- fabric outside combined with a luxurious fur lining -- when animal rights activists attacked the use of fur in fashion and decreed the fur coat obsolete in the 1990's. The Fendis were quick to notice the subtle return of the fur coat in recent years, slowly reintegrating it into their winter collections. The new Fendi outerwear for fall-winter 2010, presented Thursday, first day of the four-day Milan fashion week, is an innovative combination of fur and fabric. Large patches of luxurious furs -- broadtail, fox and sable -- are interspersed with rich woolen fabrics to create a fashion mosaic in bold colors ranging from green and blue to yellow and deep red. The favorite style for the latest look is a wide, three-quarter length jacket with big pockets and asymmetric lapels. Sylvia Venturini Fendi, the second-generation designer, who in tough fur times reinvented the label by creating the popular "baguette" bag, walked the runway with Lagerfeld at the end of the show. For next season she offers a large leather handle bag with robust metal corners to make sure the pricey bag is a long-term investment. To go with the furs, Fendi offers chic outfits with ballerina skirts and belted tops paired with vintage booties. For the first time in many a season, Venturini Fendi made heavy use of the double-F logo fabric that was all the rage in the 1980's. "The logo is no longer seen as a way to show off, but as a sign of trust in the label," she told reporters after the show.Iran will study a Japanese offer to enrich uranium for Tehran to allow it access to nuclear power for peaceful purposes, Iran's parliamentary speaker Ali Larijani said Thursday in Tokyo. A Japanese nuclear energy expert meanwhile told AFP he doubted Japan now has the technical capacity to follow through on such a proposal. The offer was made, with US backing, in December during a Tokyo visit by Iran's top nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, the Nikkei business daily has reported, although Japan's government has not yet confirmed the plan. "We need to study this proposal by Japan," Larijani said in a speech, a day after he met Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama and Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada. World powers suspect Iran is enriching uranium to make nuclear weapons under cover of its civilian energy programme, but Larijani reiterated Tehran's stance that the fuel is for a research reactor making medicines. Japan, the only country to have been attacked with atomic bombs, has long been a strong proponent of nuclear non-proliferation efforts, while it also has good ties with Iran, one of its main energy suppliers. Hatoyama urged Larijani on Wednesday to prove to the world that its nuclear project is for peaceful purposes and not to make weapons. Teheran should implement UN Security Council resolutions and fully cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency "to remove all the doubts about Iran's nuclear development", Hatoyama told Larijani. Iran has so far failed to take up an IAEA offer under which Russia would enrich its uranium and France would process it. Tehran this month said it had begun enriching uranium itself to a higher level. Larijani was on Saturday due to visit the western Japanese city of Nagasaki, which was hit with an American atomic bomb at the end of World War II, three days after a US nuclear attack devastated Hiroshima. Hatoyama said he hoped Larijani would see the "horror" wrought by nuclear weapons in Nagasaki. The premier added that Japan regards Iran as "an important country" and wishes to further enhance bilateral relations. Larijani, in his speech, commented on US President Barack Obama's stated goal of working toward a nuclear-free world. "I do want him to start pursuing the goal," he said. "The United States have tens of thousands of nuclear warheads. The issue has to be resolved as the existence of nuclear weapons poses a grave threat to the earth." A Japanese nuclear energy expert cast doubt on whether Japan would have the capacity to follow through on its reported offer to Iran. "The current capacity is getting short even for enriching uranium for Japan," said Nobuaki Arima, a uranium enrichment expert with the agency for natural resources and energy. "It would be difficult for Japan to accept a foreign country's demand for enrichment, at least for now."Republican California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger came out swinging Sunday morning on the stimulus bill -- but against members of his own party. Speaking to host Terry Moran on ABCs "This Week" program, Schwarzenegger accused Republicans of being hypocrites for bad-mouthing the Recovery Act championed by President Obama while also eagerly accepting stimulus money for projects in their states. "Well, you know, to me I find it interesting that you have a lot of the Republicans running around and pushing back on the stimulus money and saying this doesn't create any new jobs, and then they go out and they do the photo ops and they are posing with the big check and they say, isn't this great?" he said. "Look what the kind of -- the kind of money I provide here for the state, and this is great money to create jobs, and this has created 10,000 new jobs and this has created 20,000 new jobs. And all of these kind of things. It doesn't match up." That is the argument the White House has been making for more than a week, as the one-year anniversary of the Recovery Act passage sparked a fresh debate about its effectiveness. Schwarzenegger has long been a thorn in the side of the national Republican party on this subject. During the debate over the stimulus package, Schwarzenegger endorsed the proposal and stood by Obama's side in the months after its passage. "I have been the first governor of the Republican governors to come out and to support the stimulus money because I say to myself, this is terrific, and anyone that says that it hasn't created the jobs, they should talk to the 150,000 people that have been getting jobs in California," Schwarzenegger said.The Eagles were the first band to charge $100 for a concert ticket 16 years ago. Now the group is raising prices on prime seats, making the cheap ones cheaper and squeezing scalpers. The band's April 27 show in Sacramento, Calif., uses Live Nation Entertainment Inc.'s "dynamic" ticketing service that mimics airlines' approach -- a first for a major group. By setting 10 prices based on anticipated demand, instead of the usual two to four, the Eagles are selling seats closer to what they fetch on resale sites such as EBay's StubHub. The aim is to make tickets affordable for more fans and to fill seats, according to Marc Robbins, who helped design the system for the Eagles' manager, Live Nation's Front Line. The result lifts food and merchandise sales while slicing into the markup of scalpers who profit from tickets initially priced too low in the $4.4 billion worldwide concert market. "The idea is to shift the economic value from the brokers, who get the difference between the face value and the resale value, to the primary market where it can go to the artists, promoters and venue operators," said Brett Harriss, an analyst with Gabelli & Co. in Rye, N.Y., which owns the shares. Concerts are increasingly important for the music industry. Worldwide ticket sales more than doubled in 2009 from $1.7 billion in 2000, while compact disc sales fell 65 percent, according to Billboard magazine. The average ticket price rose 54 percent to $62.57 from 2000 to 2009, according to Pollstar, which tracks the concert business. The Eagles test highlights ticketing changes made possible by Live Nation's merger last month with Ticketmaster Entertainment, a deal opposed by consumer groups. As the world's largest concert promoter, venue operator, ticket seller and manager of artists, the Beverly Hills, Calif.-based company has more leverage to make changes that drive revenue and profit. Dynamic pricing has been tried by professional baseball teams including the San Francisco Giants. It uses technology to continually adjust ticket prices for some seats based on demand. At the 17,000-seat Arco Arena, the Eagles are testing a limited version that set prices in advance. Aisle seats are worth more than those in the middle of a row, for example. In some systems, changes can be made in real time. The band and show organizers are keeping total ticket revenue comparable to other stops on the tour, which runs from April 16 to May 18, said Robbins. Eagles tickets priced as high as $250 are being used to reduce others to as little as $32, the lowest for the band since 1980. Tickets went on sale Feb. 8 and more than half sold for less than $52, the lowest price on other stops, according to Robbins. He declined to say how many seats were involved in the public sale and said the system needs additional testing. The $32 seats in Sacramento use a paperless system that limits ticket transfers and further shuts out resellers. "We're pricing the tickets, not just at what the market will bear, but according to people's budgets," Robbins said. Demand will determine the revenue at future concerts using dynamic pricing, according to Robbins. Getting more people in the door addresses a longstanding problem in the live concert business: empty seats. Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino told Congress last year 40 percent of seats go unsold. Ancillary sales average $12 to $14 per concertgoer, Rapino said then. More ticket sales also add to commissions. "If you can put somebody in there for $20 where it would have been empty, it's a gain for the industry," said Harriss. The Eagles event may presage future changes. Technical advances allow prices for live entertainment to be adjusted in real-time, said Barry Kahn, CEO of Qcue Inc., an Austin, Texas- based ticketing company that works with baseball's Giants. "Tickets in the concert industry have been very poorly priced, and there is no better evidence than seeing what tickets get sold for on the secondary market," said Kahn.English far-right lawmaker Nigel Farage faces a reprimand from the head of the European parliament next week for calling EU president Herman Van Rompuy a "damp rag" and describing Belgium as a "non-country." The video of a planned speech by the UK Independence Party MEP, delivered as Van Rompuy squirmed in his seat, has quickly become an YouTube hit since causing outrage in the parliamentary chamber on Wednesday. Belgium's prime minister also articulated his anger on Thursday, saying self- styled bad boy loudmouth Farage's outburst had "shamed" the European parliament and "brought the institution into disrepute." In a letter to its president, Yves Leterme warned that the Belgian people would not tolerate any repeat of "the particularly discourteous remarks about Belgium." He told Jerzy Buzek not to "underestimate the effect on my fellow (Belgian) citizens." Buzek "envisages" applying sanctions on Farage, according to the parliament president's entourage. A spokesman for UKIP, which wants to take Britain out of Europe but has minimal following outside England, said that Buzek had summoned Farage to his office next week. "We received a message from Buzek's office saying come to see the headmaster on Tuesday afternoon, with a view to taking things further," the spokesman told AFP. Farage, whose speeches have previously been denounced as unparliamentary by critis, outdid himself in the chamber. "I don't want to be rude," said Farage. "But really you have the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low- grade bank clerk. "Who are you? I'd never heard of you, nobody in Europe had ever heard of you... "I sense though that you are competent and capable and dangerous, and I have no doubt that your intention is to be the quiet assassin of European democracy and of European nation states. "You seem to have a loathing for the very concept of the existence of nation states. "Perhaps that's because you come from Belgium, which is pretty much a non- country," he told the former Belgian PM, who has made a low-key entrance into European politics since assuming the new role of EU Council president in December. "Sir, you have no legitimacy in this job at all," he concluded. Farage appeared in no mood to back down on Thursday. "If they think describing the EU council president as a wet rag and doubting his charisma is so upsetting they should get out more and grow up," he said. "This is politics, it isn't a game." A political source said that Buzek had the powers to suspend him from EU parliament meetings or dock his expenses. There were unconfirmed reports that Farage would turn up for his dressing down from the "headmaster" in shorts and a school cap.Biathlon double-gold winner Magdalena Neuner on Monday apologised for criticising Winter Olympics doping controllers and for claiming medallists were treated like "lambs being taken to slaughter". Neuner and German team-mate Simone Hauswald issued a statement to clarify that they did not intend attacking the dope testing system. After winning her second gold and third medal of the Games on Sunday, Neuner had said doping officials treated the medallists like "lambs being taken to the slaughterhouse" while Hauswald said she had never been treated so badly. "Our statements did not intend to criticise the doping test system, this is supported by us fully and actively," read the pair's apology. "Our criticism referred to some haphazard incidents in the finish area at the biathlon venue which made it difficult for us to enjoy our medals." After winning Sunday's mass start title, Neuner announced her surprise decision not to compete in Tuesday's team relay which could have brought her a third gold. The German pin-up said she wanted to stand aside to allow other members of the team to try and win a medal, but she criticised Sunday's doping controllers at Whistler Olympic Park for their lack of sensitivity. "After crossing the finishing line, we were treated worse than lambs being taken to the slaughterhouse," she told German daily newspaper Bild. "We were pushed and pulled about and force was applied. It really spoilt the mood." After crossing the line, all medal-winning athletes are escorted to the testing centre by doping officials and Neuner says her experience left a lot to be desired. "They charge around loudly with five people behind them," Neuner added, referring to the doping officials. "You can't enjoy the moment of winning a gold medal at all. I find it incredible that they have such little respect for the athletes." Hauswald, who won bronze behind Neuner in the mass start, was also left unimpressed. "At the doping test centre, they read out a long list of names, you had the feeling it was like talking to a brickwall," said Hauswald. "You aren't treated like a person there, I have never experienced such a stressful doping test. I became a bit unrestrained myself after the experience." In the wake of her medal-winning exploits Neuner, 23, was quick to herald the end of her Vancouver Games campaign. "That was my last run - I am finished with the Olympic Games," she said after winning her third medal. "It was my decision. But I think that the other girls are all on form and want to secure a medal." In Tuesday's relay, Germany are set to call up the quartet of Hauswald, triple Olympic gold medallist Kati Wilhelm and double gold-medallist from Salt Lake City, Andrea Henkel with Martina Beck expected to take Neuner's place.Carlo Janka is the first to admit that he would trade his Olympic giant slalom gold with that of Swiss teammate Didier Defago in the downhill. Janka, nicknamed the "Iceman" for keeping his emotions in check, stormed to gold in the giant slalom on Tuesday, having kept his cool on a second run to add the Olympic mantle to his world title in the discipline he won last year in Val d'Isere. "I would have chosen the downhill," the 23-year-old said when asked which event he would have preferred to own gold. "It is the king discipline in alpine skiing and if you are champion, you are one of the greats. "My second choice is giant slalom, and I'll take it!" Janka, who led after the first leg, clocked a combined total in the giant slalom of 2min 37.83sec to finish ahead of Norwegian duo Kjetil Jansrud and Aksel Lund Svindal. "I'm feeling relaxed now," Janka said. "This was my last chance to get a medal so there was a lot of pressure there. "There have been three events in which I have not had the success I wanted. It has not been the easiest Games for me. "You must always take a lot of risk to win. I had no mistakes from the top to the finish. "It is fantastic to be an Olympic champion. I have achieved it at 23 years of age. It is just amazing," Janka continued, adding that he had no truck with his nickname: "It's okay. I am who I am." Janka, who is also reigning world downhill bronze medallist, said he had been able to swallow the pressure from ski-crazy Swiss fans. "They are really fantastic. It has been a great day for me and it's been a great Olympics for the whole Swiss team." However, he had a word of consolation for team-mate Didier Cuche, who finished 14th, 1.62sec off his pace, to continue his rotten run of form after impressing early in the season on the back of a strong 2009 worlds. "He came into the Games as favourite in three disciplines. It's very tough. It's been a bad Olympics for him. But that's sport and you cannot change it. I would have liked him to win a medal." Silver medallist Jansrud said he was delighted to have made the top three. "It's unbelievable to be on the podium at the Olympics," said the 24-year-old. "I felt like I had no chance of making the podium. It is kind of hard to express my emotions." Team-mate Svindal's bronze saw the big Norwegian tie with American Bode Miller in having won a gold, silver and bronze at these Games. "It's all about the moment, and each medal is special," Svindal said of his haul. Miller crashed out on the first leg on Tuesday, leaving Svindal to pull level in what he described as a "special" moment in mounting the podium with a younger teammate. "It's cool to share the moment," he said. "But Janka, he crushed us. He earned his medal for sure."World No.1-ranked Lorena Ochoa shot a 4-under 68 for a share of the lead after the first round of the HSBC Women's Champions in Singapore. Americans Angela Stanford and Cristie Kerr plus Hee Young Park also had 68s in the $1.3 million event at the Tanah Merah Country Club. Ochoa got off to a fast start, shooting three birdies for a 33 on the front nine. The Mexican cooled off as the wind picked up, leading to two bogeys before birdies on two of the last three holes. Four players were one shot off the lead, including No. 4 Ai Miyazato of Japan, who won last week's season-opening LPGA Thailand. Last year's winner Jiyai Chin shot a 1-under 71 while Michelle Wie was four stokes from the leaders after a 72.Spanish coach Vicente del Bosque has denied that there is any friction with Rafael Benitez regarding the treatment of Fernando Torres. The Liverpool striker will be a key member of del Bosque's squad at the 2010 World Cup, but has been sidelined for much of this season with a knee injury. He returned after a six-week lay-off against Manchester City on Sunday and is expected to be included in del Bosque's squad to play France on March 3. "There's no truth in the fact that Benitez has complained - we have great relations with Liverpool," said the coach at FIFA's Team Workshop here. "We just want to take care of the player like his club does and make sure he arrives at the World Cup fully fit." The former Real Madrid boss also stated that he hopes rumours linking Cesc Fabregas with a return to Barcelona at the end of the season would be put on hold until the end of the World Cup. He said: "I just hope that nothing happens during the World Cup because we want him to concentrate on playing and not a transfer." Del Bosque led Spain to a record-breaking 35 matches unbeaten before that run was ended by the United States in the semi-finals of the Confederations Cup last year. The coach admitted that they had learnt from their mistakes and was confident they would benefit from the experience. "Last time was a good experience to come here and get used to our surroundings and the climate," he said. "The players learnt a lot and I think that will give us an advantage. The World Cup will be a momentous occasion for Africa and it will be a great experience for everyone." Another concern for Spain is the number of their squad who could be involved the latter stages of this season's Champions League. Barcelona, Real Madrid and Sevilla are all in the last 16 and despite Real's 1-0 defeat to Lyon last week, del Bosque revealed that he hoped all three could progress further. "It's good for Spanish football if they all do well and it doesn't really worry me about the World Cup because they will have time to recover," he said. "I hope that two of our teams do get to the final because it will mean they are ready to play at the top level for their country." But while his England counterpart Fabio Capello was bombarded with journalists' questions, the two times Champions League winner was largely ignored. Del Bosque was asked whether the furore surrounding the sacking of John Terry as captain would harm their chances of rivalling his team for the title. He said: "England are one of the favourites and they always will be. Every coach has an opinion and they do what they think is right. I'd prefer to talk about football."Nigerian Acting President Goodluck Jonathan has assured Nigerians that the ship of state was on course with the return of ailing President Umaru Yar'Adua. Yar'Adua returned to Nigeria in the early hours of Wednesday from Saudi Arabia where he had been on medical treatment since Nov. 23, 2009. Yar' Adua is said to be suffering from acute pericarditis. In a statement sent to Xinhua on Thursday, Jonathan thanked Nigerians for their prayers both for the president and for the nation. According to Jonathan, Nigeria was still battling with the pains of development and progress. He said all hands must be on deck to ensure that the integrity of the nation was maintained at all times. In the statement, Jonathan urged Nigerians to continue to work for peace, security and stability of the country.Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand will miss Sunday's League Cup final against Aston Villa due to a back injury. Ferdinand's injury stopped him taking part in United's 3-0 league win over West Ham at Old Trafford on Tuesday and boss Sir Alex Ferguson confirmed the England captain won't be fit in time for this weekend's match at Wembley. "He felt a twinge in his back this morning (Tuesday) when we did a warm-up at (United's training ground) Carrington. We can't take any chances. He won't be playing on Sunday," Ferguson told Sky Sports News. "Rio has been training great too. There have been no mishaps at all. But when you get these twinges you can't take a chance." The former Leeds star has played just three times in 2010 as a result of injury and suspension. Ferdinand's injury also casts doubt over his ability to play in England's friendly against Egypt at Wembley on March 3, which was due to be his first international outing since replacing John Terry as England captain. Ferguson could also be without Brazilian midfielder Anderson for the Villa clash after he limped off with a serious knee injury during the win over West Ham. "We have sent him for a scan," Ferguson said. "Hopefully it is not too serious but it did not look good."The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Tuesday returned the government's plea for review against the apex court verdict on National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO) declaring it ultra vires of the constitution. The registrar office of Supreme Court returned the petition after placing different technical objections on it. The federal government had filed a petition in the Supreme Court, praying for reviewing its judgment of December 16, 2009, declaring NRO as violative of various provisions of the constitution. The incumbent Pakistan People Party (PPP) government pleaded the court to review the verdict regarding re-opening of cases under the NRO. The NRO was issued in 2007 by former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf as part of a political deal to allow current Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari's wife, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, to return from years of exile to Pakistan. The decree granted amnesty to more than 8,000 members from all political parties, including Zardari and a number of PPP leaders, who had been accused of corruption in the media and some of whom had pending indictments.Two U.S. senators proposed on Wednesday a bill that would create a new type of visa for foreign entrepreneurs who plan to create job opportunities for Americans. The legislation, titled "StartUp Visa Act," was raised by Democratic Senator John Kerry and Republican Senator Richard Lugar, suggesting to grant a type of two-year visa to foreigners who can prove they are going to invest at least 250,000 U.S. dollars in America. The immigrant entrepreneurs can apply for the visa if their businesses would "create not fewer than five new full-time jobs in the United States, employing people other than the immigrant's spouse, sons or daughters," says the legislation." Global competition for talent and investment grows more intense daily and the United States must step up or be left behind." Kerry is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee and Lugar is the most senior Republican on the committee. According to the bill, foreign entrepreneurs who hold the new type of visa can apply for permanent U.S. residency if they can continue to attract at least a million dollars or earn at least a million dollars in revenue. Since the economic crisis in 2008, the U.S. government has been struggling to contain the unemployment rate under 10 percent. Job creation has become the issue Americans concern most and topped Obama administration's agenda in 2010.In a league of her own, reigning world champion Kim Yu-Na made a perfect Olympic debut at the Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver, blowing away all her rivals with a record mark of ladies figure skating short program on Tuesday. "I'm glad that I have performed all that I have practised," said the 19-year-old Korean, who entered the Olympic Winter Games as a strong favorite that no skater in decades has. "I couldn't stop thinking about the fact that this is the Olympics," Kim said. "I have been waiting for this for a really long time. I felt comfortable and I was able to enjoy my short program today." Copying a 007 pose of holding a gun in the end of her James Bond routine, Kim drew all the audience into her display with more personality and scored a world record of 78.50 points to beat her main rival Mao Asada of Japan. Having played a great performance, Asada, also 19 years old, hit a triple axel but failed to cope with the triple-double combination that she had planned, scoring a personal best of 73.78 points and being ranked the second before Thursday's free skate. Kim, coming up to the ice right after the Japan's top female skater, nailed a triple lutz-triple toeloop, a bigger combination than Asada did, and hit all her elements, the spins, spirals and footwork, in a terrific way. "Mao skated perfectly," recalled Kim at the mixed zone after her competition. "I was a little worried. But no, there was no pressure." "I tried to keep focus on my short program," she added. As South Korea's first skater to win an ISU Championships (in the 2006 junior worlds) as well as the first to win a medal at a senior worlds, Kim has raised South Korea's hopes of its first Olympic gold medal in figure skating. The highly expected teenager, however, said she's not under pressure ahead of Thursday's long program. "I can think of it in two ways. I could let the pressure get to me or I could try to maintain the good start I had today," she said. "My goal is to focus on each performance. I have one more day to practise and I'm not worried because I think I have the best coach (Canadian Brian Orser) of my life. "My stamina and training in both Toronto and Vancouver has been perfect," she added. Kim has lost only once since the bronze medal-taking performance at the 2008 world championships, but the one who had beaten the Korean is Asada, the 2008 world champion who trailed Kim with a deficit of no more than five points.PORT CHARLOTTE Rays principal owner Stuart Sternberg truly is excited about this season. His goal is "to be playing meaningful games in the month of September," and he thinks they've got the team, particularly the pitching, to do so and compete with the mighty Yankees and Red Sox. It's just that there are so many other issues and uncertainties about his squad. There's the potential, if not probable, loss of stars Carl Crawford and Carlos Pea via free agency, though Sternberg says the Rays will do what they can to keep them. There's the impact of a "bad" renewal rate on season tickets and how that further dents their hopes to increase attendance overall. There's the plan to significantly reduce payroll after this season, the price of spending or, as he says, "overspending" what they are now. And, of course, there's the issue of getting a new stadium. Sternberg talked on those topics, and others, during a 30-plus-minute media session as his team went through its first workout of the spring. On retaining stars Crawford and Pea Sternberg called Crawford "a face of this organization" and said the leftfielder has been "a great Ray," and even "a great Devil Ray." Then he said, "We're going to do everything we can to make sure he stays here longer." The reality, though, is it will be difficult, as Crawford makes $10 million in the last year of a six-year, $33.5 million deal he significantly outplayed and is looking to make up for. Sternberg spoke similarly of Pea, who makes $10.125 million in the last year of his contract. And, technically, he didn't dismiss re-signing both, as unlikely as that is since he already said the payroll is headed under $60 million. "You can do anything," he said. "As my mother said to me, for money, you can have anything. But we have a limited amount of money, and you have to make choices. It's a challenge. They're both players, I could say quite frankly, I'd love to have here for years. They're tremendous guys. They're everything you want on a baseball team." On tickets, attendance The Rays won't provide numbers, but their season-ticket base is considered one of the game's lowest. Sternberg said the rate of renewals from last year, when some fans bought based on 2008's postseason run, has been "bad not good" and the drop-off significant. And that follows last year, when attendance fell far short (more than 20 percent) of Sternberg's goal of matching the major-league average of 30,351; the Rays averaged 23,148. "We haven't closed the book on it yet. We're stilling selling season tickets, we're getting renewals," he said. "The numbers are still up dramatically from where we are when we took the place over, and we'll see as it progresses. But it's the lifeblood of the organization. Sponsorships are doing great, our ratings on TV are great, our radio ratings are great, everything else is fine. "But for some reason, people are choosing not to come out as they do in other parts of the country for Major League Baseball." On reducing payroll in the future After increases to $63 million last season and in excess of $70 million this year, the payroll is headed down significantly next year "a good deal lower," he said at least into the $50 million range, if not lower. But with a number of high-priced veterans coming off the books and many good, young and low-paid players, Sternberg said he expects them to be able to remain competitive, pointing out they won the AL East in 2008 with a $43 million payroll. "Things happen," he said. "It all starts with what's going on with the arms. If these guys have the kind of season that we expect of them and they expect of themselves, we will be competitive next year because they're going to be there next year."

Under the agreement, Bharti is to pay 10 billion dollars when the deal is completed and the remaining 700 million dollars one year after it is signed, the company said in a statement on Kuwait Stock Exchange's (KSE) website. The sale of operations in 15 African nations will increase company shareholders' equity by nine billion dollars, it added. Zain's operations in Sudan and Morocco are excluded. "After paying certain commitments, the company expects to achieve returns of up to five billion dollars," the statement said. Following the announcement, Kuwait's bourse lifted a freeze on the company's shares that was imposed on Sunday. Its share price immediately shot up by 9.3 percent. The market capitalisation of Zain, which accounts for just under 16 percent of KSE's total market value, also rose from 16.1 billion dollars on Thursday to 17.6 billion dollars. The company said the agreement has a penalty clause of 150 million dollars to be paid by the party that revokes the deal. The issue of distributing the profits from the sale as dividends will be decided at the company's general assembly, Zain said. Zain's board of directors will hold exclusive discussions with Bharti Airtel until March 25 to conclude the deal, which is still subject to due diligence and customary regulatory approvals. The agreement was approved unanimously by the company's board of directors that includes a representative of the state, which owns a 24.6-percent stake, indicating the Kuwaiti government's support for the sale. Zain entered the African market in 2005, buying the assets of Dutch firm Celtel for about 3.5 billion dollars. Later, Zain made key acquisitions that extended its presence to new African countries, including Nigeria, and also expanded in the Middle East with investments exceeding 12 billion dollars. Zain regionally operates in Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia as well as Kuwait. The proposed sale will reduce Zain's customer base to under 30 million subscribers as more than 60 percent of its existing clients, numbering 72 million, are in Africa. If concluded, the deal will virtually end years of an ambitious expansion drive led by former CEO Saad al-Barrak, who resigned earlier this month and was replaced by Nabil bin Salamah. Barrak, who was appointed in 2002, had hoped to make the company one of the top 10 global telecom firms by 2012. But his plans met with snags in Saudi Arabia and most of the African countries where it operates, which cut deeply into Zain's profits. At present, it is the third largest telecom firm in the Gulf after Saudi Telecom and Etisalat in the United Arab Emirates.In a league of her own, reigning world champion Kim Yu-Na made a perfect Olympic debut at the Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver, blowing away all her rivals with a record mark of ladies figure skating short program on Tuesday.

Therese Rochette, 55, reportedly died overnight of a heart attack at Vancouver General Hospital. The reigning world silver medallist, Rochette is Canada's hope of a first gold in women's figure skating. The Rochette family arrived in Vancouver on Saturday and Therese Rochette was taken to hospital early Sunday morning. Joannie's father Normand broke the news to the skater at the athlete's village, Skate Canada president Benoit Lavoie said. He said that Rochette, 24, still intends to compete at the Games. The women's short program is scheduled for Tuesday. "The Rochette family arrived yesterday from Montreal. Joannie's father, Normand, went to the Olympic Village very early this morning to announce this sad news to Joannie and her long-time coach Manon Perron," Lavoie said. "We offer our most sincere condolences to the Rochette family." Rochette did not attend the draw on Sunday morning for the women's short programme but will practise later in the day, Skate Canada said. "Skate Canada will support the decisions that she will take in the coming days," Lavoie. Rochette is hoping to become the first Canadian woman to stand on the podium since Elizabeth Manley in Calgary in 1988.Carlo Janka is the first to admit that he would trade his Olympic giant slalom gold with that of Swiss teammate Didier Defago in the downhill.

I have achieved it at 23 years of age. It is just amazing," Janka continued, adding that he had no truck with his nickname: "It's okay. I am who I am." Janka, who is also reigning world downhill bronze medallist, said he had been able to swallow the pressure from ski-crazy Swiss fans. "They are really fantastic. It has been a great day for me and it's been a great Olympics for the whole Swiss team." However, he had a word of consolation for team-mate Didier Cuche, who finished 14th, 1.62sec off his pace, to continue his rotten run of form after impressing early in the season on the back of a strong 2009 worlds. "He came into the Games as favourite in three disciplines. It's very tough. It's been a bad Olympics for him. But that's sport and you cannot change it. I would have liked him to win a medal." Silver medallist Jansrud said he was delighted to have made the top three. "It's unbelievable to be on the podium at the Olympics," said the 24-year-old. "I felt like I had no chance of making the podium. It is kind of hard to express my emotions." Team-mate Svindal's bronze saw the big Norwegian tie with American Bode Miller in having won a gold, silver and bronze at these Games. "It's all about the moment, and each medal is special," Svindal said of his haul. Miller crashed out on the first leg on Tuesday, leaving Svindal to pull level in what he described as a "special" moment in mounting the podium with a younger teammate. "It's cool to share the moment," he said. "But Janka, he crushed us. He earned his medal for sure."The New Zealand government said on Thursday that Fiji's reluctance to re-appoint Australian and New Zealand High Commissioners was not a surprise. Fiji's Prime Minister Commodore Voreqe Bainimarama told Auckland- based Radio Tarana that there will be no re-appointment of high commissioners for at least two years unless New Zealand and Australia remove sanctions. A spokesman at New Zealand Foreign Minister's Office said that this should not affect recent progress to reopen the respective diplomatic missions in Suva and Wellington next month, Radio New Zealand reported. He said Bainimarama's statement is a clarification of Fiji's position following a recent statement by New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully that sanctions against Fiji are to remain in place. McCully himself has declined to comment on the latest call by the Fiji's government. This year he has met the Fiji Interim foreign minister, Ratu Inoke Kubuabola, several times in a bid to shore up bilateral ties. There have been tit-for-tat expulsions of top diplomats from Fiji, Australia and New Zealand since a military coup in Fiji in 2006. Bainimarama said the issue is unlikely to be resolved for some time. He also said he may soon hold talks with Mr McCully in Hong Kong. Bainimarama deposed the elected government of Fiji in December 2006. It was the fourth coup in Fiji since 1987.Carlo Janka of Switzerland won the men's giant slalom race at the Vancouver Olympic Winter Games on Tuesday. Janka, who led after the first leg, clocked a combined total of two minutes 37.83 seconds over the two runs down the Dave Murray course. Norwegian outsider Kjetil Jansrud took silver at 0.39 seconds with team-mate Aksel Lund Svindal, who has already won super-G gold and downhill silver, claiming bronze.Latin American and Caribbean nations sought to distance themselves from traditional US influence with a proposed pan-American alliance excluding the United States and Canada, at a summit in Mexico Monday. Leaders of more than 30 nations began their two-day summit in the beach resort of Cancun with the new regional grouping at the top of the agenda. The new mechanism would serve as an alternative to the Organization of American States (OAS), which includes the North American neighbors and has been the main forum for regional affairs in the past half-century. "It's time to realize the unity of Latin America and the Caribbean," Mexico's conservative President Felipe Calderon said at the opening of the summit bringing together the Rio Group, which was created in Brazil in 1986, and the Caribbean Community (Caricom). The Mexican president asked the attending 25 heads of state and government, as well as foreign ministers, to put aside their political differences following decades of painful Cold War-era battles between the left and a US-backed right. But the move, first proposed in 2008 by Brazil, came as left-right divides were as wide as ever across a region struggling for consensus in the aftermath of a military-backed coup in Honduras. Topics under discussion included whether to recognize Porfirio Lobo as the legitimate president of Honduras, after he was elected in November under a de facto government, following the June 28 coup against Manuel Zelaya. Other key issues included plans to help Haiti recover from last month's devastating earthquake, and Argentina's quarrel with Britain over oil drilling offshore from the disputed Falkland Islands. Venezuela's firebrand President Hugo Chavez led support from the region's leftists, including Ecuador, Bolivia and Nicaragua, for the proposed new regional group as a move away from US "colonizing" in the region. "Let's see if I can convince the heads of state... that an organization of American states is better without North American imperialism," said leftist Bolivian President Evo Morales before the meeting. The terms of the new group were not yet clear, or whether it aims to replace the Rio Group, but it was expected to be included in a final statement on Tuesday. Some saw Mexico's backing for the move as a bid to prove its clout in a region often led by initiatives from further south in the region. But many remained sceptical about what could be achieved in Cancun. "The conditions to create a new bloc and arrive at a common agenda don't exist," Olga Pellicer, a former Mexico representative at the United Nations, told AFP.Sri Lanka's star cricketer and former captain of Sri Lankan Cricket Team Sanath Jayasuriya confirmed on Wednesday that he will contest the forthcoming general election to be held on April 8. Jayasuriya told reporters that he has been invited by President Mahinda Rajapaksa to contest the election under the ruling coalition United People's Freedom Alliance from the Matara district of the Southern Province. Jayasuriya who addressed two main political rallies of President Rajapaksa during the recently concluded presidential election period did not comment on his future as a cricketer. The 42-year-old Jayasuriya, nicknamed "Master Blaster" by international cricket analysts, is the oldest playing cricketer in the world. Meanwhile, former Sri Lankan cricket captain Arjuna Ranatunga who led the Sri Lankan team to win 1996 World Cup and former captain Hashan Tilakaratne would contest the election on the ticket of the main opposition United National Party. Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa dissolved parliament on Feb. 9 and the new 225-member parliament is scheduled to meet on April 22.A top leader of Niger's new military junta defended last week's coup, saying Sunday the army overthrew the uranium-rich nation's dictatorial president to restore democracy after he refused to step down when his mandate expired. Col. Djibrilla Hima Hamidou spoke after talks with a delegation of senior diplomats from the United Nations, the African Union and a West African regional bloc. The diplomats told reporters they were encouraged by junta assurances that it would restore civilian rule through elections "as soon as possible" and establish a new constitution after a dialogue with political and civil groups. Mutinous troops turned against President Mamadou Tandja on Thursday, attacking the presidential palace in daylight while a Cabinet meeting was under way. The surprise assault allowed the putschists to disable the entire government, which was immediately dissolved, in one fell swoop. The coup -- which left several soldiers dead -- has been condemned by the U.N., African regional bodies and foreign governments, including the U.S. But many in the capital, at least, appear relieved that their president-turned dictator is out of power. Hamidou compared the latest coup to the desert nation's last one, in 1999, during which a junta composed of many of the same officers went on to organize democratic elections that Tandja won twice. "This is not an army with a putschist tradition, that is not the case," Hamidou told reporters at a military barracks in Niamey. "In 1999 we had a similar situation. We gave power back and we had 10 years of stability." This time, Hamidou said: "We are going to do the same thing." Tandja had grown deeply unpopular after forcing through a highly criticized referendum in August that replaced the country's constitution with a new one containing no ban on how many times he could run for president. It also gave him an unprecedented three-year extension of his rule before another round of elections could be held. In the months before the referendum, Tandja had already gone the way of despots across the continent: cracking down on the press, jailing opponents, imposing rule by decree and dissolving parliament and the constitutional court because they opposed his plan to stay in office. After Tandja's legal mandate expired Dec. 22, the U.S. and Europe cut off non-humanitarian aid, vital to a country that is one of the world's poorest. The crisis continued, however, and negotiations to resolve it hit a dead end. "We gave time to see if the political actors could find a compromise solution, but it didn't happen," Hamidou said. "Tensions rose, and (the crisis) had to be stopped ... we are now trying to restore legality." Economic Community of West African States chief Mohamed Ibn Chambas said after talks with junta leaders including their chief, squadron leader Salou Djibo, that the visiting diplomats had pressed the putschists to restore "constitutional civilian rule." "We were encouraged by the fact that the authorities themselves are mindful that this is not their normal function, and they are eager to finish this task and to go back to their normal military and security duties," Chambas said. The junta has yet to lay out a timetable for elections, Chambas said, but its leader said they want a ballot to happen soon and the date would depend on a national dialogue involving political and civil society leaders. "They said they want a short transition that will end as soon as possible," Chambas added. Nothing has been heard of Tandja since he was spirited away by soldiers during Thursday's attack. Hamidou said the toppled leader is being held in a presidential villa and the International Red Cross will be allowed to visit him Monday. Hamidou declined to elaborate on what Tandja's fate would be, saying only: "for now, we are taking care of his security and his health." By Sunday, all but three ministers had been released from house arrest, Hamidou said. Those still being guarded include the prime minister and the interior and finance ministers. A Niamey-based diplomat said several older, pro-Tandja military generals had also been put under house arrest when the coup began because they could not be trusted. Hamidou, however, said no member of the armed forces was being held. Niger has gained notoriety in recent years with a spate of kidnappings in its lawless northern deserts, where a low-level rebellion led by ethnic Tuareg insurgents finally calmed last year. Al-Qaida's North Africa branch has claimed responsibility for taking a handful of foreigners hostage in the same region, including a Canadian later freed who was the U.N.'s special envoy. The desert country of 15 million is ranked at the bottom on the U.N.'s worldwide human development index and has an astounding 70 percent illiteracy rate. The nation on the Sahara's southern edge has been perpetually battered by drought and severe food shortages. ------ Associated Press Writer Dalatou Mamane contributed to this report.They had to wait four years, but the U.S. women's hockey team finally avenged a semifinal defeat against Sweden at the 2006 Turin Games by trouncing the Swedes, 9-1, in a semifinal Monday at Canada Hockey Place. The victorious Americans were thinking only of their next game, which will come Thursday when they play for the gold medal against Canada, a 5-0 winner against Finland in Monday's other semifinal. "Once we leave the rink today it doesn't matter what we just did," said Monique Lamoureux, who led the U.S. attack with three goals. "We're focusing on Thursday and Canada and being ready for that." At Turin, the Swedes defeated the United States, 3-2, in a shootout, after goalie Kim Martin stopped 37 shots. Martin was in the goal for Sweden again Monday, but she was unable to work the same magic as the United States outshot her team, 46-12. "What happened in '06 was disappointing for USA Hockey," coach Mark Johnson said. "But this is a different group." The Americans' dominance Monday provided little relief for supporters of women's hockey. It was the sixth of the tournament's first 15 games to be decided by eight or more goals, the Americans and the Canadians winning three each. "We've been focusing on playing that gold medal game all year," said Angela Ruggiero, who had a goal in her 250th game for the national team. While she might not have meant it that way, Ruggiero's words were indicative of the foregone conclusion that this women's tournament has become one decisive game between Canada and the United States, preceded by several preliminary games nearly bereft of drama. The only goal the Americans surrendered Monday came on a power play, from Pernilla Winberg halfway through the game that made the score 4-1. The United States also gave up a power-play score to China earlier in the tournament, but those are the only goals it has allowed here. Through four games, the Americans have outscored their opponents, 40-2. "They're really playing good hockey in front of me and making it easy," goalie Jessie Vetter said. "I am a cheerleader back there."Ailing top-seed Roger Federer has pulled out of the two-million-dollar ATP Dubai Open due to a lung infection, officials said here Sunday. "He has got a lung infection," said ATP circuit official Stephen Duckett. "He saw a doctor and he was advised not to play for a fortnight." According to the ATP's website Federer, who picked up the infection last week, will return in the ATP World Tour Masters at Indian Wells in March. Federer, a four time Dubai champion, was due to appear here for his first tournament since beating Andy Murray to win his fourth Australian Open at the start of the month. That was the Swiss ace's 16th Grand Slam and it secured him the top ranking for a 268th week. The victory in Melbourne ensured that the 28-year-old kicked off the new season firmly ensconced at the top after winning Wimbledon and the French Open last year. The world number one was out for revenge in his second home city here in Dubai where play opens Monday, both by deposing Novak Djokovic as champion and by getting the better of Murray, who beat him in his last appearance here in 2008. These two 22-year-olds present the most immediate threats to Federer's world number one ranking with Rafael Nadal slipping to fourth in the latest ATP rankings. Federer was due to play Julien Benneteau of France in the first round here with a potential date with Murray in the semi-finals. He won the title here in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2007 and was runner-up in 2006.Tanith Belbin, the American ice dancer, arrived at her two-bedroom suite at the athletes' village and found it looking as if someone had been living there for weeks. Her suitcases, which she had dropped off earlier, had been emptied. Her clothes were neatly put away in drawers or hung up in the closet. An Audrey Hepburn poster, with the saying, "I never meant to be an icon, I just do my own thing," had been tacked onto the wall in the common room. She noticed right away that her roommate, Johnny Weir, had already made his mark. He had spent the last few days looking for pink bath mats for their bathrooms to please Belbin, whose arrival had been delayed by a blizzard. Belbin, a five-time national champion with her partner, Ben Agosto, is 25. Weir, a three-time national champion, is nine days older. Both have been to the Olympics before. At the 2006 Games, Belbin won the silver medal with Agosto. Weir was fifth. Both are medal contenders here. Weir established himself as a diva early on in their relationship, Belbin said. Once, when Weir visited her family in Detroit, he came to breakfast wearing a pink bandana on his head and sunglasses she called "the size of his face." "My dad was just staring at him while eating his breakfast, and Johnny just said, 'Please, I don't have my face on yet,"' she said.Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende said Sunday Dutch troops will begin leaving southern Afghanistan in August, since his caretaker government has no authority to accept a NATO request to stay on. Speaking a day after his coalition government collapsed over the issue, Balkenende said the Netherlands will end its role in Uruzgan province, where 21 Dutch soldiers have been killed since the mission was first deployed in 2006. "Our task as the lead nation ends in August this year," he said on Dutch television. A marathon cabinet meeting that broke up before dawn Saturday ended with the walkout of the second largest party in the government, Labor, which accused the dominant Christian Democratic Alliance of reneging on a 2007 agreement to bring the troops home this year. On Monday, the premier formally will advise Queen Beatrix that he no longer commands a majority in parliament and will hand in the resignations of the six Labor Party ministers. That will begin the process likely to lead to an election in May, one year ahead of schedule. The impending drawdown was clearly bitter for Balkenende, who argued forcefully to remain in Uruzgan on a scaled-down training mission for Afghan security forces. He repeated Sunday that it would be valueless to conduct such training missions outside Uruzgan. Under the Dutch system, a caretaker cabinet cannot take actions that lack consensus, and therefore Balkenende said he was bound by an earlier decision to relinquish the command position in Uruzgan as of Aug. 1. The pullout will take up to three months, and the last of its soldiers will be gone from the volatile province by December. Earlier this month, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen sent a letter to the Dutch government asking it to consider an extension of its mission to prepare the Afghan army and police to take responsibility for the province. Balkenende charged that Labor went back on its agreement to at least examine several options for staying in Afghanistan. The parliament was expected to hold another debate on Afghanistan shortly, taking up the question of whether the Air Force could deploy F-16s, helicopters and headquarters staff and whether development workers and even diplomats could be stationed outside Kabul, the capital. But the current mood in parliament is hardly amenable to a continued presence there. In the debate last Thursday, a clear majority of the 150-member house was in favor of pulling out, with the split laid bare between Balkenende and his finance minister, Labor Party leader Wouter Bos.Sunderland boss Steve Bruce was hit Monday with a 2,500-pound fine for an outburst over referee Andre Marriner's handling of his side's 4-3 defeat by Manchester City in December. Bruce was enraged by Mariner's dismissal of defender Michael Turner for an aerial challenge with Gareth Barry and described the red card he issued as "obscene", "a joke" and "an outrage". That led to Monday's judgement from the Football Association, which found Bruce guilty of improper contact having also dismissed Sunderland's appeal against Turner's sending-off.Duty editor: Albion Land News desk: +357 22 391 420 Middle East news agenda for Monday + Israel FM meets EU counterparts amid Mossad row BRUSSELS: Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman meets with European foreign ministers amid a growing diplomatic storm over the use of false European passports in the assassination of a senior Hamas militant in Dubai.

(YEMEN-UNREST-SHIITE)Olympic gold medal favourite Kim Yu-Na expressed her delight Sunday after her draw position for the short programme in the women's Olympic figure skating competition. The South Korean has been drawn number 23 in the 30-skater field and will take to the ice Tuesday third in the second-last group just after her great rival Mao Asada of Japan. "I was hoping not to skate last," said the reigning world champion. "So I was really happy about it." Kim will bid to become the first South Korean Olympic figure skating champion, with the free skating final on Thursday. "Yesterday the ice felt a little wierd for me, but today it was okay. I tried to train like in Toronto. Overall it was a great practise." But she added: "I'm not sure she'll (Miki Ando) like it." Japan's Miki Ando, 22, put her hand to her head after drawing the unenviable position of last on the ice in the Pacific Coliseum. "I actually like skating last but not at the Olympic Games," said the 2007 world champion. "I think I'm going to get nervous but I can't change anything. This nervous feeling I hope to turn it into a good thing." Asada, the 2008 world champion, was happy with her position. "It's the best," said the 19-year-old. Canada's Joannie Rochette, whose 55-year-old mother Therese died of a heart attack early Sunday, did not attend the draw in which she was placed 26th, and will take to the ice first in the final group on Tuesday. The six-time Canadian champion and reigning world silver medallist practised on Sunday morning just hours after hearing the news of her mother's death.Scottish champions Rangers announced on Wednesday a profit of just over 13 million pounds (20 million dollars) in interim results for the six months up to the end of 2009. Boosted by funds gained from qualifying for this season's Champions League, turnover at Ibrox rose by 17.7 million pounds (27.8 million dollars) to 37.8 million pounds (59.3 million dollars). Consequently, Rangers revealed a retained profit of 13.1 million pounds (20.5 million dollars), compared to a retained loss of 3.9 million pounds (6.1 million dollars) for the same period last year. Rangers' results were made public just two days after their arch Glasgow rivals Celtic announced a decrease in turnover of almost 23 percent for the six months to the end of 2009. Celtic revealed in their interim results a turnover of 36.11 million pounds (56.58 million dollars), down 22.8 percent on 46.8 million pounds (73.3 million dollars) compared to figures released this time last year, with the Hoops saying failure to qualify for the Champions League' group stage played a major factor in their financial downturn. Rangers had, before Wednesday's results, been a reported 31 million pounds in debt with manager Walter Smith claiming the Ibrox club were effectively being run by Lloys Bank, a claim the club later refuted, although their financial position has all but stopped the club signing new players. The Light Blues are currently 10 points clear of Celtic at the top of the Scottish Premier League but Rangers chairman Alastair Johnston warned the club's dependence on Lloyds was "not desirable". He said: "Whilst the interim results are pleasing, a degree of caution is required as the future outlook is fraught with challenges. "We continue our efforts to source a capital injection into the club to fuel the ambitions of the staff, supporters and shareholders, all of whom have been remarkably supportive as we navigate through the turbulence. "Until such time as this is achieved, we are compelled to maintain our working relationship with Lloyds TSB Bank plc. "The board understand that reliance on such a facility going forward is not desirable if we are to retain control over the club's destiny and avoid negatively impacting the potential for future success." Senior players Kris Boyd, Allan McGregor and Madjid Bougherra all stayed at Ibrox during the January transfer window but doubts remain about their long-term Rangers' futures. However, Johnston warned: "Discussions continue on various contract extensions, although a balance has to be struck between value and player expectations."The United States pulled off its biggest Olympic hockey upset since the Miracle on Ice, stunning Canada 5-3 on Sunday to advance to the quarterfinals of an already mixed-up tournament. Brian Rafalski scored two goals and set up another, and Ryan Miller held off a flurry of shots to lead the Americans. One day short of the 30th anniversary of America's greatest hockey victory -- the unfathomable win over the Soviet Union at the 1980 Lake Placid Games -- these underrated Americans were faster, more disciplined and more determined than Canada's all-stars. Better, too, even as Canada outshot the United States 45-22 yet couldn't badly dent Miller, the goalie the Americans felt could best stand up to all of Canada's stars. He did, too, making 42 saves. Depending on the later Finland-Sweden game that concluded hockey's Super Sunday in Vancouver, the United States could go into Wednesday's quarterfinals not only as a group winner but as the top-seeded team, something almost no one predicted when the tournament began. Chris Drury and Jamie Langenbrunner scored to put the United States up 4-2 and hold off a relentless late surge by Canada that included Sidney Crosby's power play goal with 3:09 remaining. Miller made an exceptional save on Rick Nash's shot from the slot with two minutes left to preserve it, and Ryan Kesler put it away by scoring with 45 seconds remaining. Rafalski, Langenbrunner and Drury are three of the older, steadying hands on one of the youngest U.S. Olympic teams in history, one that averages 5 years younger per man than the 2006 team that didn't medal in Turin. Canada, the gold medal favorite, was expected to coast into the medal round but now, after nearly losing to Switzerland and being outplayed on home ice by the Americans, must win a play-in game Tuesday to reach the quarterfinals. The Canadians still have a chance to win a gold medal, but now face a much tougher road that would include an additional game.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's controversial wife Sara said in court papers filed on Wednesday that a former housekeeper suing her for abuse was treated with love. Responding to the charges in a Tel Aviv court, Netanyahu called the allegations in the lawsuit "false, outrageous and scandalous." Former housekeeper Lillian Peretz claimed that while in Netanyahu's employ, she did not receive all her due benefits and had to endure Netanyahu's whims. Netanyahu "piled on her impossible tasks, tyrannised her and screamed at her... insulted her femininity ... until her mental and physical collapse," she wrote in the complaint. The 44-year-old mother of four claimed she was paid less than the minimum wage and the Netanyahus did not pay her social benefits when she worked at their weekend home in the plush coastal town of Caesarea between 2004 and 2009. However, in the response filed Wednesday, Netanyhu said Peretz "worked for the Netanyahu family for six years because the defendant treated her with warmth and love." Attached to the papers were hand-written notes, apparently from Peretz to the family that read "love you the most in the whole world." The case sparked a series of allegations against Netanyahu, who responded with libel suits against two major newspapers. Her husband has also tried in vain to get the media to stay out of his family affairs.The lead stories in major Taiwan dailies on Sunday are as follows: @The China Times: Taiwan will launch NT$6 billion project to develop interoperable computerized medical record system @The United Daily News: `Au Revoir Taipei' wins NETPAC award at Berlin International Film Festival @The Liberty Times: Institutional investors optimistic about Taiwan's stock market prospects @Central Daily News online: President Ma Ying-jeou stumps for Kuomintang candidate in Hsinchu County legislative by-election @Economic Daily News: Semiconductor stocks set to rally as B/B value surges to six-year high @Commercial Times: 15 blue-chip stocks expected to lead local bourse to new peak @The China Post: Wang signs with Nationals @The Taiwan News: Dutch government collapses over Afghan mission @The Taipei Times: Johnny Chiang to join CabinetRadio presenter Chris Evans thanked listeners and rugby fans Monday for their messages of support after his cousin sustained a serious injury playing for Scotland against Wales in the Six Nations. Thom Evans was carried off on a stretcher after a sickening collision with Wales full-back Lee Byrne at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium and then underwent neck surgery, with the 24-year-old Glasgow wing now ruled out of the remainder of this season's Six Nations. BBC Radio Two breakfast show host Chris Evans, writing on social networking side Twitter, said: "Thom news, so much support - overwhelming to be honest and talk of him going home to Glasgow." Then, on the BBC Radio Two website, Chris Evans expressed sympathy for the Welsh players involved in the challenge. "Thom and his family have always known the risks involved in such a physical sport but nothing can prepare you for such an incident. "They have been as strong for him as is humanly possible over the last 48 hours - as of course they will continue to be - and all things considered - the future looks comparatively bright. "My thoughts go out to the players involved in the tackle and I know Thom would want them to feel no responsibility whatsoever for his accident. "It was simply 'one of those things' that unfortunately sometimes happens in the marvellous sport of rugby." Scotland, despite being 10 points in front with four minutes left, lost 31-24 as Wales staged an extraordinary rally in the closing stages. Defeat for Scotland was made worse by the fact that, as well as Thom Evans, Chris Paterson and Rory Lamont also suffered tournament-ending injuries. Full-back Paterson, who was winning his 100th cap, had to leave the fray having suffered bruising to his kidney while wing Lamont suffered a medial ligament injury. Scotland's next Six Nations match is away to Italy in Rome on February 27.Colombia's 2007 French Open junior finalist Mariana Duque Marino won her first WTA title here on Sunday as she beat fifth seed Angelique Kerber of Germany 6-4, 6-3. The 20-year-old Colombian - ranked a lowly 143 in the world - was her country's first winner of the tournament since Fabiola Zuluaga won her third successive title in 2004. "I am very proud to play in my first final here," said Duque Marino. "This is really positive for Colombia and for me," added the victor, who was claiming the scalp of her second seed of the week. Duque Marino, who turned professional in 2005 and whose best previous WTA performance was a quarter-final in this tournament, was ecstatic at her victory. "It is fantastic. I played really well against a high quality rival."France's Michael Llodra beat his compatriot and doubles partner Julien Benneteau 6-3, 6-4 in the final of the Open 13 tournament in Marseille on Sunday. Unseeded Llodra lost in the final to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga last year and did not blow his chance this time around, blasting a total of 14 aces past the 28-year- old number eight seed to wrap up the match in just over one hour. "Today I served very, very well at the key moments. Against someone like Bennet(eau) who returns so well, I had to raise my service game," Llodra said after his victory. Benneteau appeared tired after his gruelling 3 hour semi-final clash against second seed Tsonga on Saturday and the match began to slip from his grasp in the sixth game of the opening set when Llodra broke his serve. The 29-year-old broke his double partner's serve again in the fifth game of the second set, beating his opponent with an audacious lob. Benneteau was left to rue a missed opportunity to win his first-ever title on the ATP tour. "Maybe if I had been more alert, more active, I would have placed one or two passing shots a bit better that would have made the difference but this is not the reason for my defeat, he was simply stronger," said Benneteau, who has now lost four finals on the ATP tour. Benneteau had been due to play world number one Roger Federer in the first round of the Dubai Open on Monday but the Swiss ace has pulled out after being struck down with a lung infection. The Frenchman will now meet Spain's Tommy Robredo.Switzerland's Michael Schmid won the gold medal Sunday in the Olympic debut of skicross, defeating Austria's Andreas Matt in the final. Schmid, the World Cup leader this season, took a big lead early in the medal race and made it to the finish line without any contact. Audun Groenvold of Norway took bronze over Canadian Chris Del Bosco, who fell on the second-to-last jump.Veteran Brazilian Wanderlei Silva knocked down England's Michael Bisping in the final 10 seconds and went on to claim an unanimous decision in a middleweight bout at the MMA's UFC 110. Before a crowd of nearly 20,000 Sunday at Acer Arena in UFC's first foray into Australia, Silva, nicknamed "The Axe Murderer," staged a late flurry to claim the fight. Silva, with a record of 33-10-1, won the PRIDE world championship in Japan for five years in a row. Bisping, of England, 19-3, was the UFC's winner in its third season. The Sydney event was headlined by a later heavyweight bout between veteran Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira and unbeatean Cain Valasquez.The Dalai Lama says he doesn't fault President Obama for his low-key reception in Washington because he recognizes that the president must juggle ties to the Tibetan spiritual leader with concerns about angering China. The Dalai Lama told The Associated Press he understands that Obama must be practical in exercising his commitment to human rights worldwide. "No disappointment. The last six decades my heart hardened. I do not consider important political gestures. I don't care. The important is meet face-to-face," said the Dalai Lama, who was sometimes assisted by a translator. "With President Clinton, the first meeting was a 'drop-in,'" he said. "People asked me the same question (then). I don't care." The Dalai Lama made the remarks while in Los Angeles to support Whole Child International, an organization that advocates better care for orphans worldwide. Obama hosted the Dalai Lama on Thursday in Washington, D.C., but kept the get-together off-camera and low-key in an attempt to avoid inflaming tensions with China. Revered in much of the world, the Dalai Lama is seen by Beijing as a separatist seeking to overthrow Chinese rule of Tibet. Though he says that is untrue, China regards any official foreign leader's contact with the Buddhist monk as an infringement on its sovereignty over the mountainous region and as a particularly unwelcome snub. Meetings between the Dalai Lama and U.S. presidents became standard nearly 20 years ago, but they are always delicately choreographed and scrutinized because of China's sensitivity. This time, China had urged Obama not to meet with the 75-year-old spiritual leader, saying the visit "seriously harms U.S.-China relations." The Dalai Lama said Saturday it is crucial for the U.S. to develop an economic relationship with China without forgoing America's founding principles. "You should develop cordial, close relations, mainly in the economic field at the same time (as) your principles, these universal values of democracy and rule of law," he said, as he sat in an armchair in his hotel suite, with his bare feet tucked under him. "In these principles, you should stand firm." The Tibetan spiritual leader also briefly addressed the Tiger Woods scandal and the golf star's public comments Friday about straying from his Buddhist faith. Woods said he was raised Buddhist but needed to focus anew on finding balance between his faith and professional life. The Dalai Lama said he did not know who Woods was, but said self-discipline is among Buddhism's highest values. When it comes to adultery, he said, "all religions have the same idea." "I think mainly whether you call it Buddhism or another religion, self-discipline, that's important," he said. "Self-discipline with awareness of consequences."Ian Poulter of England is in the final of the Match Play Championship for the first time. He has to wait until Sunday to find out who he'll play. Paul Casey and Camilo Villegas played 23 holes of their semifinal match until they could no longer continue because of darkness. The match appeared to be over until Villegas missed a 3-foot par putt for the victory. Instead, they will return Sunday morning to find out who will advance. Poulter was in his hotel room having a hot bath and a massage, having earlier dispatched of Spaniard Sergio Garcia, 7 and 6, to equal the shortest match of the tournament.Result Sunday from the Open 13, a (EURO)512,750 ($697,400) ATP World Tour indoor hardcourt event at Palais des Sports (seedings in parentheses): Singles Final Michael Llodra, France, def.

"On the subject of sanctions, Russia's position remains unchanged. Russia still believes that Iran should more actively and broadly cooperate with the IAEA and other countries," the spokeswoman Natalia Timakova told reporters. "If these obligations are not fulfilled no one can exclude the application of sanctions." She said Medvedev had conveyed this message to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during talks in Moscow Monday. Netanyahu also met Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Tuesday but the Russian strongman made no public comment on the Iranian nuclear standoff in the talks. "Israel is our longstanding partner in the Middle East," said Putin. "We are in constant contact about the Middle East peace process and economic ties are developing well too," he added. During his talks with Medvedev in Moscow, Netanyahu had asked Russia, which is believed to wield significant influence with Tehran, to help slap "biting" sanctions on the nation. Russia has long said it favours peaceful resolution to the Iranian problem but signs have emerged over the past weeks that the Kremlin is finally losing patience with the Islamic republic over its defiance in the nuclear crisis. Israel, considered to be the Middle East's sole, if undeclared, nuclear power, views Iran as its top enemy after statements by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that the Jewish state was doomed to be "wiped off the map". Bringing Moscow on board for harsher sanctions has been a key goal of Israel and the United States. Russia has long-standing ties with Tehran and is helping to build Iran's first civilian nuclear power plant in the city of Bushehr.Glenn Beck, the popular conservative talk show host, and Newt Gingrich, who led the Republican revolution in 1994, received rousing receptions from thousands of cheering supporters on Saturday as an annual gathering of influential conservatives wound up its conference here. Gingrich and Beck were among the speakers who championed limited government and lower taxes at the three-day Conservative Political Action Conference. Beck, a hero of the political right and the keynote speaker at the conference, offered a sweeping denunciation of progressivism, which he said was a cancer that must be cut out of the political system. But he aimed his fire at Republicans as well as Democrats, and gave them little quarter, saying he did not know what the Republicans stood for. "It's not enough just to not suck as much as the other side," he said. Beck, a recovering alcoholic, drew a parallel to addiction recovery programs and said that the party had to admit that it was in trouble. "Hello, my name is the Republican Party, and I have a problem!" he declared. "I'm addicted to spending and big government," he said, drawing cheers from the audience in a ballroom of the hotel where the conference was held. But both parties are to blame, he said. The Democrats tax and spend, while the Republicans just spend. He also said people were losing a fundamental belief that things would get better. "It is still morning in America," he said. "It just happens to be kind of a head-pounding, hung-over vomiting-for-four-hours kind of morning in America. And it's shaping up to be kind of a nasty day. But it is still morning in America." Blaming President Barack Obama for the nation's problems was "too simple an answer," Beck said. The real problem, he said, is progressivism, scrawling the word with chalk on a portable blackboard, a prop from his television show. "This is the disease in America," he said. In more measured remarks earlier on Saturday, Gingrich called for "principled bipartisanship" at a health care summit next Thursday at the White House with the Democrats -- what he called the "secular socialist machine." Gingrich, a former speaker of the House, made a rock-star-like entrance, wading into the audience to the throbbing beat of the song "Eye of the Tiger," a searchlight flashing across the crowd as he shook hands with well-wishers. He predicted that the Democrats would lose both the House and Senate in November and Obama would lose in 2012, undone by "the coming massive conservative majority." He said that the Democratic health care proposals -- all 4,500 pages from the House and Senate combined -- "are among the worst legislation" ever to emerge from Capitol Hill. Obama should begin by tossing out the health bills passed by the House and Senate and start from scratch, Gingrich said, and Republicans should have the same amount of time that Democrats will have to present their views at the summit. "Let's test the president's willingness to be bipartisan," he said. Unlike some of the other conservatives who addressed the conference, Gingrich gave little hint that he plans to run for president in 2012. He has said that he would make up his mind by next February. Other possible contenders for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, including former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, used the gathering as a platform to test their popularity with the attendees. Rep. Ron Paul, a Republican congressman from Texas who inspired an intense following for president in 2008 and who also addressed the gathering, swept the presidential straw poll, winning with 31 percent of the nearly 2,400 votes cast. He edged Romney, who won the straw poll last year and who captured 22 percent of the vote on Saturday. When Paul's name was announced in the packed ballroom, it elicited hoots and boos along with applause. Although Romney won fewer votes, he seemed to draw stronger applause.Japan's foreign minister Sunday described Australia's threat of legal action against its controversial whaling activities as "unfortunate" but said he did not believe it would hurt ties. "It's very unfortunate the Australian side has indicated it will take action in an international court," Katsuya Okada told reporters on the second and final day of a visit to Australia. "Should court action become a reality, then Japan will seek to represent its case to the IWC (International Whaling Commission) supporting the fact that its activities are legal and within the convention." Okada, the first official from the new Japanese government to visit Australia, said however that the dispute should not affect relations between the two major trading partners. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd on Friday bluntly warned Japan that it had until November to reduce its whale catch to zero, or face action in the International Court of Justice. Australia, along with New Zealand, has consistently opposed Japan's killing of hundreds of whales each year, which it carries out via a loophole in an international moratorium that allows "lethal research". Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said Australia remained hopeful of a diplomatic solution but he reiterated Rudd's vow that Canberra would seek redress in the ICJ if talks failed. "It's quite clear that we have a disagreement on whaling," Smith said after meeting Okada in the Western Australian capital of Perth. "I made clear to Foreign Minister Okada in the course of our conversations (that) Australia believes that time is running out," he added. Smith said Canberra had "in the last week or so" decided to bring a proposal before the IWC that whaling in the Great Southern Oceans be phased out over a reasonable period of time. The case would be taken to the IWC in the very near future, Smith added, "potentially as early as tomorrow (Monday)." Okada insisted before leaving Tokyo that Japan's whaling activities were legal, carried out in public waters and in accordance with international conventions. He and Rudd had a "frank discussion on whaling" during their meeting in Sydney on Saturday. For the past six years Japanese harpooners have been pursued by militant environmental activists from the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, and this year clashes have been particularly fierce. Okada and Smith both condemned the violence, which has seen a Sea Shepherd powerboat sunk, and the detention of one of their activists. A group of about 10 Sea Shepherd campaigners confronted the pair during an official wreath-laying in Perth's war cemetery, staging a silent protest against the annual whale hunt. "For the past two years, by its lack of action, the Rudd government has effectively given Japan the green light to ram and sink ships and kill endangered species," a Sea Shepherd spokesman said. Rudd had previously threatened Japan with legal action, and the spokesman said it was "hard to believe" he was serious this time. Okada and Smith also discussed free trade, security and nuclear disarmament, issuing a joint statement affirming their close cooperation on non- proliferation, and expressing serious concern over Iran's atomic drive. The statement also condemned "in the strongest terms" North Korea's latest nuclear test and missile launches last year and said the reclusive state remained a "major threat" to peace and stability in the region and the world "which cannot be tolerated." Japan is Australia's top export market, with sales worth 55 billion Australian dollars (49 billion US) in the year to June, dominated by coal and other commodities. Japan is also Australia's third-largest source of imports -- mostly cars and petroleum -- with two-way trade accounting for 15.7 percent of Australia's total trade.Italian Serie A side Udinese sacked coach Gianni de Biasi on Sunday, replacing him with Pasquale Marino, a former coach who was fired to make way for de Biasi just two months ago. DE Biasi is paying the price for Udinese's poor form this year. Despite having the most prolific striker in the Italian division -- Italian international Antonio Di Natale -- Udinese are in 16th place after winning just once under de Biasi who took over in December. After Saturday's 3-0 defeat to seventh-placed Genoa he become the 14th Serie A coach to lose his job this season.Dual ski jumping gold medallist Simon Ammann of Switzerland said Sunday at the Vancouver Winter Olympics that he was grateful to be compared to his compatriot Roger Federer. "Sometimes they compare me to Roger Federer. It's a comparison I shirk away from. He wrote his own history in tennis. But ski jumping is not like tennis as far as techniques are concerned and the successes. But I am very grateful for the comparison," Amman said to a press conference held in Whistler Media center. Although he rewrote the history of ski jumping with his four gold medal in 2002 Salt City Winter Olympics and this time in Vancouver, Ammann still doesn't consider himself as legend. "I'm basically quite happy. Everything is on track. But how are legends supposed to feel? Some are no longer around to tell us. I know what happened after Salt Lake," he said. About his plan for the future, Ammann said because of some changes in the regulations for next year and in the Swiss team, "so let's see what happens there ...But for the moment it is not realistic to say something clear (about competing in Sochi)." Ammann has captured an unprecedented Olympic double, adding large hill gold to normal hill victory on Saturday, just as he did in Salt Lake City eight years ago. The 28-year-old, competing in his fourth Olympics, has been in peerless form at the Whistler Olympic Park and soared to jumps of Olympic record-setting 144 meters and 138 meters for a total of 283.6 points to seal a commanding victory.The wife of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has denied suggestions she is the power behind the throne, saying that while she speaks her mind, she is not involved in government decisions. "It is not something that I am sensitive of as it is not true," Rosmah Mansor told state news agency Bernama Friday, insisting she was not the hidden hand behind the premier's policies. "Maybe I am a bit vocal or gregarious," she said. "But it does not mean that since Datuk Najib is a reserved person, I am making the decisions. "I am the type who will voice out my dissatisfaction, but once said, it is done." Malaysia's first lady, who has a reputation for being outspoken, said she and her husband are "best friends" but that his soft-spoken demeanour should not be underestimated. "Do not provoke him. If he is angry, there is no forgiveness for you," she reportedly said. Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who is on trial for sodomy, earlier this month accused Najib and Rosmah of being behind the sex allegations. "These are trumped-up charges involving two black hands -- Najib and Rosmah," said Anwar, who was sacked as deputy prime minister and jailed on similar charges a decade ago. Anwar, who was released from jail in 2004 after the sexual misconduct count was overturned, has made a comeback to politics as the leader of a reinvigorated opposition.Wayne Rooney could miss England's friendly with Egypt on Wednesday after the Manchester United striker revealed his League Cup final winner against Aston Villa was scored despite a knee injury. Rooney was left on the bench at Wembley on Sunday due to a combination of a stomach bug and a knee injury, but he came on as a first half substitute and headed the 74th minute goal that ensured United retained the League Cup. However Rooney felt the knee bothering him during the second half and he admitted after the match that the injury would have to be assessed by England's medical staff when he joins up with Fabio Capello's squad at their Watford hotel. "I've just had a tweak for the last couple of weeks and I felt it again in the game," Rooney said. "I'll probably get it looked at by the England doctors and see how it is." United manager Sir Alex Ferguson insisted he would leave the decision over Rooney's participation in the England match up to Capello and company. "Our doctor's assessing him at the moment, I don't know what we are going to do, I don't know what England are going to do," he said. "There's a lot of big games coming up now and that's why we didn't play him from the start, but he's had 45, 50 minutes."Michael Schmid of Switzerland snatched the first ever ski cross Olympic gold as he pushed himself forward in the men's ski cross final at the Vancouver Olympic Winter Games here on Sunday. Schmid led the qualification in one minute and 12.53 seconds and kept finishing the following three knockout stage races first to advance into the big final. Then the 25-year-old construction worker overcame strong opponent Andreas Matt of Austria to win the Olympic debut event. World champion Matt finished second and Norwegian Audun Groenvold grabbed the bronze medal. Canadian hopeful Christopher Delbosco fell off after a big jump and failed to finish.Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is to visit key ally Damascus on Thursday for talks with Syrian counterpart Bashar al-Assad, the official SANA news agency said. It said the two leaders would also attend a religious ceremony to mark Prophet Mohammed's birthday. The visit comes after Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said Damascus was determined to help Iran and the West engage in a "constructive" dialogue over Tehran's contested nuclear programme. "Sanctions are not a solution (to the problem) between Iran and the West," Muallem said on Saturday. "We are trying to engage a constructive dialogue between the two parties in order to reach a peaceful solution." He insisted that despite Western claims "Iran does not have a nuclear military programme." French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said during a weekend visit to Damascus that Syria can help find an agreement on Iran's nuclear drive. Western governments suspect that the nuclear programme in Iran -- which earlier this month started higher grade uranium enrichment -- is cover for a drive to produce a bomb. Iran, which has already been slapped with three sets of UN sanctions over its uranium enrichment, denies it has any such ambition and insists the atomic programme is solely for peaceful purposes. Damascus has been Tehran's major regional ally for the past three decades, ever since taking Iran's side in its 1980-1988 war with Saddam Hussein's Iraq.by Liu Yuehua DAMASCUS, Feb. 20 (Xinhua) -- The Syrian and French prime ministers on Saturday called for boosting economic relations between the two countries to match the level of standing political relations. Syrian Prime Minister Mohammad Naji Otri on Saturday held talks with his French counterpart Francois Fillon who arrived in Damascus on Friday evening for a two- day official visit to Syria, hailing Fillon's visit marks a new stage of cooperation between the two countries. Otri hoped that the talks will lead to bolstering cooperation in economy, trade, industry and transport, stressing to expand Syrian-French cooperation in the fields of training and education and establishing investment partnership. The Syrian prime minister invited French companies to expand investment, particularly in the fields of energy, oil, gas, transportation and public services. Otri added that Syria is looking forward to Europe and France in particular to play a more active role in the Middle East peace process, urging the international community to push Israel to lift its siege on Gaza and to rebuild the strip. Fillon affirmed that France is committed to achieving successful and fruitful cooperation with Syria and boosting economic relations to match the level of standing political relations, reiterating the desire of his country and of French businessmen and companies for working and investing in Syria. Fillon noted that the process of development in the Middle East requires peace, security and stability, affirming Syria's pivotal role in achieving peace in the region. He expressed France's readiness to work for resuming indirect negotiations between Syria and Israel in cooperation and coordination with Turkey. Syria and France on Saturday signed 11 agreements, documents and memos of understanding on cooperation in the fields of aviation, culture, education, tourism, agriculture and economy. The two sides also signed an agreement for purchasing two small 70-seat passenger planes of the ATR 72 model, in addition to extending the memo of understanding on selling 14 Airbus planes to Syrian Air. The bilateral relations between Paris and Damascus have witnessed remarkable progress in recent years. Syrian President Bashar al- Assad visited France in July 2008 and November 2009 and French President Nicolas Sarkozy paid visits to Syria in September 2008 and January 2009. Due to the positive development of bilateral relations, French companies began to invest the big potentials available in Syria, and the French Development Agency (FDA) opened its office in Damascus to fund renewable energy projects and small- and medium- sized enterprises in Syria.Former US Secretary of State Alexander Haig died on Saturday in hospital at 85. According to Haig's family, the Republican veteran politician passed away at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, from complications associated with an infection. He was admitted to the hospital on Jan. 28 and has remaining in critical condition since then, said the hospital. Haig, who was born in December, 1924, is a retired Army four-star general and served as the State Secretary under President Ronald Reagan form Jan. 22, 1981 to July 5, 1982. He also has served as a top adviser to former presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. In 1988, Haig ran for the Republican Party nomination for president against George H.W. Bush, but did not succeed.Thousands of people rallied in Niger's capital Niamey on Saturday in support of their new military rulers after a coup ousted the strongman of the uranium-rich nation Mamadou Tandja. A crowd of around 10,000 massed outside the parliament building in central Niamey Saturday following an appeal by an opposition coalition. "This is a demonstration in support of the coup, we are celebrating the overthrow of the Tandja dictatorship," former lawmaker Soumana Sanda told AFP. On Friday thousands of people spontaneously took to the streets to celebrate the coup, despite a chorus of condemnation from the United Nations and African Union which has suspended the west African country from its ranks. The opposition Coordination of Democratic Forces for the Republic called on it backers to "participate massively" in the new pro-junta rally on Saturday. Soldiers stormed the presidential palace as the 71-year-old Tandja chaired a cabinet meeting on Thursday. They seized the president, took him to a military establishment and detained his ministers. Hours later the new rulers, who call themselves the Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy (CSRD), suspended the constitution that Tandja forced through in a contested August referendum and dissolved his government. Tandja last year changed the constitution to hold to his post beyond a 10-year- limit, tightening his grip on power in a move that infuriated democratic forces and widened the chasm between him and the opposition. Some analysts suggested a coup was inevitable in the impoverished west African country plunged into political crisis by Tandja, but the military ouster drew sharp international criticism. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon was the latest to added his voice to the condemnation. He "condemns the coup d'etat that took place in Niger" and "appeals for calm and for the respect of the rule of law and of the human rights of all Nigerians," Ban's office said in a statement on Friday. The African Union (AU) announced it was suspending Niger from its ranks Friday. "We have condemned the coup and imposed sanctions on Niger: Niger is suspended from all activities of the AU," said Mull Sebujja Katende, who presides over the AU's peace and security council. The United States called for a "speedy return to democracy" and former colonial ruler France demanded fresh elections "in the coming months" while the European Union also condemned the coup. A regional grouping, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) expelled Niger last year after Tandja defied calls not to hold parliamentary elections under the amended constitution. The AU has called for Niger to revert to the constitution that was in place before Tandja's controversial referendum. Niger's new military rulers have suggested they would do so, a point that Ban highlighted in his statement. In a statement broadcast after the coup, the CSRD pledged to make the world's third largest uranium producer a beacon of "good democracy and governance" after almost a year of political crisis. Ban urged the junta to "proceed swiftly with these efforts through a process that is consensual and that includes all segments of Nigerian society." Talks between Niger's government and the opposition to end the standoff were suspended last week, having repeatedly stalled since they began on December 21.Police arrested 10 demonstrators Monday at a nuclear arms site in southern England, where two Nobel Peace Prize winners joined hundreds of protesters, a spokesman said. Five were detained after gaining access to the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) in Aldermaston, west of London, where warheads for Trident submarines are made, and five outside, said the Thames Valley police spokesman. Organisers said around 800 people joined the protests, including Jody Williams, Nobel Peace Prize winner in 1997 for campaigning against landmines, and Mairead Maguire, who won in 1976 for her work in Northern Ireland. Police put the number of protesters at 400. "People have come from all over the UK and we also have a big international contingent -- it's the biggest blockade for many years," said Kate Hudson, chairman of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). "It's a reflection of the fact that the majority of the population is against the British possession of nuclear weapons," she added. The Aldermaston site was the focus of protest marches in the 1950s and 60s, and a number of revival demonstrations have occurred over the years. Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced last year that he was willing to cut Britain's fleet of Trident missile-carrying submarines from four to three, while insisting that it must keep some nuclear-capable submarines. CND says Trident is illegal, immoral and a waste of resources, does nothing to increase world security and undermines international efforts to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction, according to the CND website.Results from the sixth day of the ATP Open 13 tournament here on Saturday (x denotes seeding): Semi-finals Michael Llodra (FRA) bt Mischa Zverev (GER) 6-1, 7-6 (7/3) Julien Benneteau (FRA x8) bt Jo-Wilfried Tsonga (FRA x2) 7-6 (13/11), 5-7, 7-6 (7/3)Syria can make economic progress by helping Middle East peace efforts, including finding an agreement on Iran's nuclear drive, visiting French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said on Saturday. "One of the conditions of continued economic development in Syria is peace and security in the region," Fillon said at the opening of an economic forum in Syria's capital Damascus. "If France decides to resume and strengthen dialogue with Syria, it will be because we believe Syria has a key role in establishing peace in the Middle East," said Fillon. "What must prevail is truth and transparency. To improve the situation, everyone must make an effort." Fillon, the first head of a French government to visit Syria in more than 30 years, singled out world powers' standoff with Syria's ally Iran over its nuclear drive as an issue in which Damascus can play a positive role. "Peace requires a change in attitude of the Iranian government," said the French premier, adding that "Iran is not complying with international rules and constantly violates UN Security Council resolutions." "We have reached out to the Iranian government without success" so far, he said. referring to Tehran's rejection late last year of an offer from the UN atomic watchdog regarding the enrichment of uranium by the Islamic republic. "We hope that Syria will help us in this effort for Iran to renounce decisions that endanger world peace," said French prime minister. Fillon was accompanied by Economic Minister Christine Lagarde, Culture Minister Frederic Mitterrand and a delegation of French businessmen when he arrived in Damascus on Friday. He held talks later with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Paris hopes to build economic ties with Syria at a time when the Arab country is opening up more and more to foreign investments as part of its reforms. Ties between France and Syria have warmed since Assad paid a landmark visit to Paris in 2008 for Bastille Day. French President Nicolas Sarkozy went to Damascus two months later, and Assad revisited Paris last November.Zhou Yang of China easily won the Olympic gold medal in women's 1,500-meter short track speedskating on Saturday in Vancouver. Zhou breezed to the finish line well ahead of Lee Eun-byul of South Korea, who earned the silver. Park Seung-hi of South Korea took the bronze. Zhou's victory was China's second Olympic gold in women's short track. Wang Meng won the 500, but she was disqualified in the semifinals of the 1,500. Zhou, the 18-year-old world-record holder, put her hands together in a thank-you gesture as she crossed the finish line of the eight-woman final. She is competing in her first Olympics.Amy Williams of Britain captured the gold medal of the women's skeleton at the Vancouver Olympic Winter Games here on Friday. Williams finished first with a aggregate time of three minutes and 35.64 seconds from four runs. It was Britain's first individual gold at a Winter Olympics since Robin Cousins took the men's figure skating title at Lake Placid in 1980. "I am absolutely speechless. It's all a blur. I can't even remember half of it," said Williams. "I just came out the bottom and looked at my coach, and I wanted to give my mum a hug," Germans Kerstin Szymkowiak and Anja Huber won the silver and bronze, in 3:36.20 and 3:36.36 respectively. Williams surprised everyone with her gold-medal performance. The 27-year-old was not even a medallist on the World Cup circuit this season. But her display on Friday was just excellent as she set two track records on her way to triumph.Senegalese Foreign Minister Madicke Niang arrived in Niger Friday, in the wake of a military coup to make contact with the new ruling junta, Senegal's foreign ministry said. Niang has "been able to make contact with the authorities in the Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy and with French authorities," the ministry in Dakar said in a statement. France is the former colonial power in both countries and has major stakes in Niger's uranium industry, which has made the poverty-stricken west African nation the world's third largest producer. "A delegation of ECOWAS (the Economic Community of West African States) is expected in Niamey in coming hours," the statement added. The ECOWAS delegation was comprised of Commission president Mohammed Ibn Chambas, mediator in the Niger crisis, former Nigerian military leader Abdulsalami Abubakar, and Nigerian deputy foreign minister Bagudu Hirse, said an ECOWAS official in Abuja. "The team will make its stand known to the junta leaders as well as meet other stakeholders in the Niger political landscape," said the official who demanded anonymity. The regional grouping ECOWAS has condemned the coup, rejecting "any change of power through unconstitutional means and violence." Senegal's President Abdoulaye Wade is an ECOWAS mediator in the Niger political crisis that triggered Thursday's military takeover. Several African institutions and countries have spoken out against the coup that ousted President Mamadou Tandja, condemning the unconstitutional seizure of power, but Dakar has not yet issued an official reaction. Tandja was in office after changing the constitution in August in a highly disputed referendum. He had been due to stand down in December. When he held contested parliamentary elections, ECOWAS suspended Niger. Senegal's Niang left for Niamey on Thursday, as the coup unfolded, but was unable to land in Niger because the military closed the borders until it had consolidated its hold on power and announced a political agenda. The Senegalese foreign minister instead spent the night in neighbouring Burkina Faso. His ministry said he was the first foreign statesman to visit Niger since the coup.A new ice resurfacing machine rushed in from Calgary after repeated problems at the Olympic speedskating rink arrived Tuesday with organisers banking on an end to disruptions to the schedule. The SOS to Calgary came after a 70-minute delay during the men's 500-metre speedskating final on Monday as staff at the Richmond Olympic Oval struggled with their malfunctioning Olympia machines, which created uneven surfaces. It followed similar problems during the women's 3,000-metre event on Sunday. Venue general manager Magnus Enfeldt said there had been no problems with races Tuesday and the aim was to have the imported Zamboni machine ready for Wednesday's events. "It has been a couple of tough days. We've been working through it. We apologise for the delays," said chief ice-maker Mark Messer. Messer said the problem was solely with the machines, not the ice. "Different machines, different problems," he said. "It's electronics. One was the drive, the other was the conveyor system. I think (the ice) is pretty good." After the end of the 500m on Monday, which was won by South Korea's Mo Tae-Bum, Enfeldt said another machine would be rushed from Calgary, hundreds of miles away. Speaking after the end of the women's 500m event, won by South Korea's Lee Sang- Hwa Tuesday, Enfeldt confirmed that a Zamboni machine had arrived and was "in good working order." "We plan to get that operational as soon as possible and hopefully even ready for tomorrow's races," he added. Women's 500m silver medallist Jenny Wolf earlier said she "didn't like the ice" at the rink but Enfeldt, in response, said only: "Consistent and fair and safe ice conditions are our number one priority." He said the machines at the rink had been working well until the recent problems. "The Olympias have been working very well. We've had them at the venue for a year-and-a-half and we just currently have experienced some issues with them." He added that the Zamboni, a specialist machine for large rinks, and Olympia machines would be used in tandem from now on.DET-DIGEST-0222 DET-DIGEST-0222 The Detroit News plans to move the following stories for clients of the New York Times News Service for editions of Monday, Feb. 22,consumer protections. OCONNOR-COL (undated) -- Hey boss! Treat your workers better. By Brian J. O'Connor. TOYOTA-LEGAL (undated) -- On the day after Christmas, one month after Toyota issued its largest ever recall, a fatal crash in a Dallas suburb involving a Toyota Avalon sedan rekindled concerns about the automaker's vehicles. On that Sunday morning, the car driven by Monty Hardy, 56, of Southlake, Texas, ran a stop sign, hit a tree and flipped into a pond, fatally injuring all four occupants. The Avalon was on the recall list, and the driver-side floor mat -- fingered in previous Toyota crashes -- was found in the trunk. Three weeks later, the Southlake police closed its investigation without coming to any conclusion. Investigators couldn't rule out unintended acceleration, but Hardy, who was taking medication for epilepsy, might have suffered a seizure. "We couldn't exclude either of those as factors in the accident," said police spokesman Sgt. Mike Bedrich. The case illustrates how difficult it may be to prove or disprove allegations of sudden intended acceleration in Toyota vehicles. Every day, new lawsuits are filed against the Japanese automaker, which is likely to find itself in litigation for years. Complaints range from losses sustained by Toyota owners because of the falling residual value of their vehicles to more damaging allegations that people died because of defects that the company was slow to acknowledge and repair. Increasingly, Toyota appears to be facing its own version of Ford Motor Co.'s crisis nearly 10 years ago over rollovers of SUVs with Firestone tires. The Ford-Firestone mess cost the Dearborn automaker just over $4 billion in terms of recalls, lost production and lawsuits -- and that doesn't include the hard-to-quantify damage to Ford's reputation. The final tab for Toyota may be higher. The Japanese automaker this month estimated the near-term cost of the two recalls -- one for sudden acceleration, and a second on Jan. 21 to fix pedals that could stick -- at $2 billion. Legal experts say Toyota's liability, particularly in suits seeking compensation for injuries or deaths, may be determined in part by revelations that emerge in congressional hearings beginning next week, as well as a deepening investigation into Toyota's handling of the issue by the U.S. Department of Transportation.

Developing.BRASILIA, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) - Brazilian President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva will meet with Cuban leader Fidel Castro on Wednesday for a meeting of "friends" during which they will discuss aspects of international politics, Lula's spokesman Marcelo Baumbach said Friday. Da Silva will arrive in Havana on Tuesday evening, coming from Cancun, Mexico, where he will attend the Rio Group Summit. Castro and Lula da Silva are friends since the early 1980s, when the Brazilian former union leader founded the Workers' Party (PT), through which he became Brazil's president since 2003. "The meeting that President Lula will have with President Fidel Castro is a visit of a friend to another, during which they will discuss current issues concerning international politics," the spokesman said. After this meeting, Lula will be present at the closure of the Working Group Brazil-Cuba on Trade and Economic Affairs, and in the evening he will have dinner with Cuban President Ral Castro. Lula's visit to Cuba next week will conclude the cycle of visits that he paid to the Caribbean country during his two terms as president. "This is his fourth visit to Cuba made during his government. In this period relations between Brazil and Cuba grew strongly," said Baumbach. Trade between the two countries reached 330 million U.S. dollars in 2009, with a high balance in favor of Brazil, around 223 million dollars. The South American country, recalled the spokesman, approved credits to Cuba amounting to about 950 million dollars, out of which 350 million will be invested in purchasing food; another 600 million dollars, in the production of rice and sugarcane, in the expansion of Mariel port and in the construction of a road. "Participation in the work of Mariel port, vital to expand Cuba' s infrastructure and increase foreign trade, shows Brazil's determined efforts in Cuba's development and trade liberalization, " he said. After his visit to Cuba, Lula da Silva will travel to Haiti, where he will present an aid plan for rebuilding the capital, Port- au-Prince, devastated by an earthquake on Jan. 12. Lula will then head towards El Salvador, where he will be greeted by his counterpart, Mauricio Funes.The golf world closed ranks around Tiger Woods Friday, welcoming his emotional public apology and looking forward to his eventual return to the game. "I was moved by how difficult it seemed to be for him, but that's a big part of the process -- to go through that difficulty and face up to what's happened," said British Open champion Stewart Cink. Cink caught part of Woods's internationally televised apology before heading to the Dove Mountain course for the third round of the WGC Accenture Match Play Championship. "We've all made mistakes and all sinned, and forgiveness is a huge part of the process," Cink said. A humbled and emotional Woods earlier broke his silence, staring into the camera at times as he apologized for a sex scandal that derailed one of golf's most successful careers. But the 34-year-old American sportsman did not set a date for his return to professional golf, saying only that it would be "one day," possibly this year. British golf great Nick Faldo said that left a "big question mark" over Woods's golf future. "He's made a complete apology," said Faldo, a former European Ryder Cup captain who now spends much of his time in the United States as a television golf analyst. "It has left a big question mark -- when is he going to return? We have had the apology but as golfers, we are back at square one," he told the Golf Channel. Faldo, who has seen personal issues of his own become public knowledge during the course of a career that yielded six majors, said the US golf star's continuing absence would be felt, but would not be catastrophic. "We all know what happens to the ratings, but golf goes on," he added. Whenever Woods participates in a tournament, television audience figures have shot up. PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem, who was among about 40 people who saw Woods make his statement in person at the PGA Tour headquarters in Florida, acknowledged that Woods was a huge drawing card. Yet Finchem also said his absence would not spell an immediate decline for the US tour. When Woods missed much of 2008 after knee surgery in June, "we had a record year financially both with respect to prize money and dollars to charity. The PGA Tour has not been negatively impacted in any significant way," Finchem said. "However, he does generate a significant increase in the overall interest in the sport, no question, and he does increase significantly the number of people that watch on television... So I don't want to minimize the long-term impact." Cynics had suggested that Woods made his remarks during the Match Play Championship because event sponsor Accenture had been one of the first companies to end its endorsement deal with him after the scandal broke. Cink, however, said Woods's remarks seemed to indicate a rehabilitation process. "I've got a couple of good friends at home that have gone through the alcohol abuse program with AA (Alcoholics Anonymous), and similar steps are taken in the healing process where you have to make amends to the people you've hurt and start the bridge to the other side, and I think that's where Tiger is," he said. American golfer Mark O'Meara, long considered one of Woods's closest friends on the professional tour, told Sky Sports: "Today was a step in the right direction. "I know he's very regretful for what he's done; he's shown that today." Woods appeared overcome with emotion at several points during his statement. "I think he was very genuine, that's Tiger," O'Meara said. "I love the kid. I know I've said before I was disappointed about what happened -- who wouldn't be? -- but with disappointment comes hope." Woods's reputation as a family man was shattered last year after a late-night car crash outside his Florida home was followed by a string of lurid revelations about his personal life, with more than a dozen women linked to the billionaire sports star.Niger's new military rulers posted tanks and trucks mounted with machine guns around the presidential palace Friday, a day after toppling veteran strongman leader Mamadou Tandja in a bloody coup. Military pick-up trucks mounted with automatic machine guns were also stationed in front of the prime minister's office and the foreign ministry, an AFP correspondent said. There was no sign of fresh violence after Thursday's gunbattles around the palace during which at least three soldiers were killed and Tanja was toppled. Other parts of the capital were calm with people going about their business as normal after a nightime curfew. The junta has so far not said where 71-year-old Tandja is being held but sources in his government have said he is being held in a barracks on the outskirts of Niamey. The Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy (CSRD) junta which took over from Tandja, sought the backing of the country's 15 million people in its bid to turn Niger into an example of a "good democracy and governance". Within hours of storming the presidential palace during a cabinet meeting chaired by Tandja, a group of military top brass announced it had suspended the constitution Tandja foisted through a controversial referendum last August. Tandja had defied outcry both inside the country and abroad at his move to change the constitution to allow himself to extend his grip on power. Junta head squadron leader Salou Djibo, whose heavily-armed unit played a key role in Thursday's coup, said in a statement read on state television that the government was dissolved. The troops said Thursday they decided to "take our responsibilities in ending the tense political situation" said CSRD spokesman colonel Goukoye Abdoulkarim.Egypt is poised to ban any gatherings in Cairo to mark the planned return on Friday of former UN nuclear watchdog chief and potential presidential candidate Mohamed ElBaradei, security sources said. The 2005 Nobel laureate, who is expected to fly home on Friday afternoon, has repeatedly called for democratic change in Egypt since stepping down as head of the International Atomic Energy Agency in November. Security sources told AFP that measures would be taken to prevent any "illegal demonstrations" by his supporters at Cairo airport. Two members of opposition group the April 6 Movement, Ahmed Maher and Amr Ali, have already been arrested for organising a reception for ElBaradei and distributing leaflets encouraging people to attend, Egyptian media reported. Since November, ElBaradei has in several newspaper interviews pointedly refused to rule out standing in next year's presidential election against veteran incumbent Hosni Mubarak, who has been in power for 29 years. But he has made his candidacy conditional on the unlikely prospect of wide- ranging institutional and political reforms to ensure a clean election. Electoral law also requires him to be a member of an authorised political party, a condition he does not currently fulfil. Despite the difficulties facing his standing for Egypt's top job, the very possibility of his candidacy has triggered a vicious campaign against him in the official press. State-owned dailies have accused him of being out of touch with the nation's affairs after his long years working abroad.A top court in Ukraine on Friday started hearing a complaint by Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko alleging that presidential elections she lost to Viktor Yanukovych were marred by widespread fraud. "Today I have come to defend not the presidential elections, I have come to defend Ukraine," Tymoshenko told reporters before the start of the hearing at the supreme administrative court. "I don't want the future of my state, my people to be built on lies, on deception as happened during the 2010 elections. "Today I will fight," said Tymoshenko. Known for her predilection for beige designer dresses, the glamorous politician wore a black outfit to the court. Around 300 of her supporters gathered outside the court to support the defiant prime minister, their numbers dwarfed by a thousand-strong pro-Yanukovych crowd. Earlier this week Tymoshenko filed a complaint with the court demanding the results from the February 7 ballot be invalidated due to what she says were mass falsifications. The court ruled that final election results be suspended while it hears the case of Tymoshenko. Yanukovych defeated Tymoshenko by around 3.5 percent or just under 890,000 votes in the election, according to the final official results. Tymoshenko contends that mass violations, which she says amount to one million votes, put the outcome in doubt. Ukraine's parliament -- where Yanukovych's Regions Party is the largest faction -- has already set the inauguration for February 25 amid fears of a looming political crisis. It was not immediately clear whether the case will be wrapped up in time for the inauguration date but the hearing is not expected to thwart the swearing-in. "Nothing threatens the inauguration," Vladyslav Lukyanov, a deputy with Yanukovych's Regions Party, told reporters before the start of the hearing. "I've already bought myself a tuxedo for the reception which will happen on the evening of the inauguration." Lukyanov said that if the court did not procrastinate it could deliver a verdict within the next two days. Tymoshenko is facing an uphill battle as international observers have already praised the elections as fair and democratic. Western leaders including US President Barack Obama have also congratulated Yanukovych on his victory. Yanukovych vowed Friday not to allow the division of Ukraine, while his party accused Tymoshenko of using her influence to pursue personal gains. "Tymoshenko continues to demonstrate a cynical and unceremonious violation of the constitution and law," the Regions Party said in a statement. Yanukovych's victory heralded a return to a more pro-Russia orientation for Ukraine after the 2004 Orange Revolution which brought a pro-Western government to power in Kiev. In 2004 he was initially declared the winner of disputed presidential polls. But following mass street protests against vote-rigging, the courts overturned his victory and ordered a new election which he lost.US envoy Richard Holbrooke indicated Saturday Washington wanted closer ties with the impoverished state of Tajikistan, saying the ex-Soviet nation was a key to peace in neighbouring Afghanistan. "For ethnic and geographic and strategic reasons, Tajikistan is the country of immense importance if one wants to have a peaceful outcome in Afghanistan," Holbrooke told reporters after his meeting with President Emomali Rakhmon. Holbrooke said he had held three meetings with senior Tajik officials in the past six months and that more would follow. The US envoy's stop in Tajikistan, the poorest of the ex-Soviet nations that shares a porous 1,340-kilometre (830-mile) border with war-ravaged Afghanistan, was part of his tour of Central Asian that began on February 17. President Barack Obama announced sending 30,000 more US troops to Afghanistan late last year in a bid to end the country's eight-year war against Islamists in the country. Holbrooke's visit is part of the US administration efforts to secure more support from useful potential allies in the region. On Friday, the US envoy met with Uzbekistan President Islam Karimov for talks on Afghanistan and also had a meeting with President Kurmanbek Bakiyev of Kyrgyzstan. "I think the real threat in this region is less from Taliban than from Al-Qaeda which wants to train international terrorists," Holbrooke said Saturday when asked to name the region's biggest security challenge. The United States and NATO already have 113,000 troops in Afghanistan battling the insurgents and NATO has pledged another 10,000, bringing the total to more than 150,000 by August.Mary MacKillop, a nun revered for her work with needy children as much as for her rebellious streak, will become Australia's first Roman Catholic saint on October 17, Pope Benedict XVI announced Friday.The Dalai Lama headed Wednesday to the United States for a meeting with President Barack Obama that has angered China, part of the spiritual leader's drive to throw a global spotlight on Tibet. The revered monk, who has lived in exile in India since 1959, will open his visit Wednesday by greeting fellow Tibetans for their Losar new year -- a day before his long-awaited meeting with Obama at the White House. The Obama administration has voiced concern about human rights in Tibet but described the meeting with the 74-year-old monk as private -- it will take place in the White House Map Room, not the seat of power in the Oval Office. But Beijing has opposed any meeting with the Dalai Lama, demanding that the United States reverse its "wrong decision" to "avoid any more damage to Sino-US relations." The Dalai Lama's advisers brushed aside China's criticism as routine and said the White House meeting sent a comforting message to those living in Tibet. "They will feel encouraged that the president of the United States, a global superpower, is meeting with His Holiness," the Dalai Lama's secretary Chhime Chhoekyapa said. "It means the world has not forgotten them." The Dalai Lama enjoys a wide following in the United States and every sitting US president has met with the Nobel Peace laureate since George H. W. Bush in 1991. Fending off domestic criticism, Obama did not meet with the Dalai Lama when he was in Washington last year in an apparent bid to set relations off on a good foot with China. Obama has sought broad cooperation with China but since the start of the year has gone ahead with decisions opposed by Beijing -- including meeting with the Dalai Lama and approving a 6.4-billion-dollar arms package to Taiwan. Leonard Leo, chair of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom, a government advisory board, said he hoped that Obama's meeting with the Dalai Lama was "not just checking a political box." Instead, Obama should seek advice on "how to think creatively" on the thorny issue of Tibet. "Beijing's objections to Obama meeting the Dalai Lama should not deter the administration from trying to bridge China's plans to improve the living standards of Tibetans and Tibetan demands for religious freedom and protection of their unique culture and language," Leo said. The Dalai Lama says he accepts Chinese rule over his homeland, where Beijing sent troops in 1950. But China brands him a "wolf in monk's clothes" and accuses him of advocating separatism. China in January held talks with the Dalai Lama's envoys, the first between the two sides since November 2008. The United States has welcomed the dialogue, but the talks have yielded no tangible progress since they opened eight years ago. Many observers believe the Chinese are simply stringing the Tibetan exiles along until the Dalai Lama dies, on the assumption that the Tibetan movement will wither without him. "The Dalai Lama and the people around him have refused to realize this and that the talks have a strategic value for China," said Elliot Sperling, an expert on Tibet at Indiana University. Sperling said that the Dalai Lama may be better off to realize that a solution is unlikely in his lifetime rather than placing hope in the talks. "They're useful for thwarting criticisms as to why the Chinese government isn't talking to the Dalai Lama," Sperling said.Times Sports Columnist We waited 85 days for Tiger Woods to show up in front of a camera. And about 85 seconds to fold, grade, interpret and spin his performance. Overall, the response has seemed evenly split, although I swear the Russian judge had it in for him. "This was largely an exercise in propaganda, with no journalistic checks and balances or input," wrote a columnist for CBSSports.com. "Think about what it must be like to apologize to the world," a journalist on SI.com asked. "I don't know what else people can ask of the guy." "I thought it was a borderline train wreck," wrote an ESPN blogger. "It amazes me that Tiger learned little to nothing from the past two months." "How much more flesh and blood do you want to extract, then?" asked a Fanhouse.com columnist. It was like watching an Olympic figure skating competition, except NBC was showing it live instead of tape delay. Look, I have no idea if Tiger was contrite or calculating. I don't know if he was sincere or shrewd. And if you're honest with yourself, you have no idea either. All we have is our opinions, and we're basing those on 131/2 minutes of amateur psychoanalysis off a TV screen. On the other hand, we are getting pretty good at this game. We winced as Mark McGwire cried through his apology. We scoffed when Pete Rose tried to sell his in a book. We adjusted the color controls on our television when Alex Rodriguez showed up for his apology with an orange tan. So maybe you think you saw conviction in Woods' eyes when he looked directly at the camera and accepted full responsibility. Or perhaps you saw damage control when he said the details of his affair will be forever off limits. To me, the most important words Woods spoke were when he was quoting his wife, Elin. "As Elin pointed out to me, my real apology to her will not come in the form of words," Woods said. "It will come from my behavior over time." And this is the reason I am inclined to believe in Tiger's sincerity. Because for the first time in his life, Woods appears to be putting other concerns ahead of his career. Go back four months and try to recall your previous image of Woods. You knew he had a family, but you didn't think of him as a family man. You knew he had a charitable foundation, but you didn't picture him as a philanthropist. You knew he had a temper on the course and was known to tell bawdy jokes in the clubhouse, but you never envisioned him as wildly emotional. No, for the past decade, we have mostly viewed Tiger in one way: As one of the most focused, ambitious and competitive athletes in history. His world was golf with a little bit of everything else sprinkled in. He was raised by his father, Earl, to be the most dominating golfer on the planet, and Woods let nothing get in his way. Not marriage. Not fatherhood. Not a damaged knee. Not even his beloved father's death. Yet now Tiger appears to be putting golf second. Even before his sexual appetite became national news, this was shaping up as one of the most important seasons of his career. The one milestone Woods, 34, has long coveted, the one many believe he requires in order to be called history's greatest golfer, is the record for major championships. Jack Nicklaus set the standard with 18, and Woods is No. 2 with 14. Supposedly, this season was going to be a grand opportunity for Woods to close the gap on Nicklaus. Three of the four majors are being played on some of Woods' favorite courses. There is the Masters at Augusta National, the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach and the British Open at St. Andrews. Of the 14 majors Tiger has won, half were on those three courses. But on Friday, Woods offered no timetable on a return to his career. He said only it could be sometime this year, which carries an unspoken implication that he might not play again for quite some time. This, more than anything he said, tells me the extent of Woods' contrition. If he is willing to postpone his career at a pivotal moment, then I'm willing to believe he has decided to put his family ahead of everything else in his life. Of course, I could be wrong. Woods could have couched his words for dramatic impact on Friday and still has every intention of being on the first tee at Augusta National on April 8. In a way, that would disappoint me more than his original transgressions. Because I want to believe him when he said he wanted to make amends. I want to believe him when he said he wanted to start living a life of integrity. I want to believe a person can screw up his life and come out better on the other side.Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on Wednesday met with commander in chief of U.S. pacific Command Robert Willard at the State Palace here, discussing the security of the upcoming visit of the U.S. President Barack Obama to Indonesia in the second half of March. Speaking at a press conference after the meeting, the commander said that the U.S. security would cooperate with Indonesian armed forces (Tentara Nasional Indonesia or TNI) and the Indonesian government to secure the visit. During his visit, President Obama would spend more than one night in Indonesia, where he had spent parts of his childhood, Indonesian Presidential spokesman Dino Patti Djalal has said. The commander said that he has confidence with the capability of the Indonesian armed forces.Japan's Okinawa Governor Hirokazu Nakaima told Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirofumi Hirano Saturday that relocating the U.S. Marine Corps' Futemma Air Station within his Prefecture would pose problems for the southernmost prefecture. Nakaima, following talks with Hirofumi at Okinawa's prefectural office in Naha, told reporters it would be "difficult" for his prefecture to accept relocation within the prefecture, local media sources said. Hirano, for his part, was quoted as telling Nakaima, "We are seeking the 'best' conclusion, but we may end up drawing a 'better ' conclusion," indicating that the central government may come up with a plan to relocate the Futemma facility within the prefecture. Hirano's two-day visit to Okinawa comes on the back of Japan's central government allegedly floating to Washington the idea of building a helipad at the Marine Corps' Camp Schwab in the Okinawa city of Nago to relocate the Futemma facility, instead of a 2006 plan agreed by the two countries to move the facility to a coastal area off the camp. However Hirofumi on Saturday again denied making any new proposals to Washington, saying the government is still considering its options from scratch. "We have not sounded out the United States about the idea. We are considering the relocation on a zero basis," Hirano told Nakaima, according to local sources. Nakaima having made it clear to Hirano that the Okinawa prefectural government prefers relocating the Futemma facility outside Okinawa, said that he wished the central government would maintain open talks with the prefectural government on the matter, so officials in Okinawa could stay informed. Hirano, reinforcing his previous comments that the central government was not acting with complete autonomy and respected the views of local officials and residents, said that the central government has set up a liaison office at the Cabinet Secretariat and its branch office in Naha to collect information and requests from local figures in Okinawa to better deal with the issue of U.S. military bases. Despite Hirano's latest fact-finding and goodwill mission, Okinawan officials, including newly elected Nago mayor Susumu Inamine, a fierce opponent of the air base being relocated to his city, have been rattled by media reports of Japan suggesting Washington consider the idea of building a heliport at U.S. Marine Corps Camp Schwab in Nago, instead of constructing an airfield with two runways off the camp as per a 2006 accord made between the two countries. Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama's government allegedly sounded out Washington about the idea in early February, along with transferring some of the Futemma exercises outside Okinawa. Reports stated the government is considering constructing a heliport about 300-500 meters long at Camp Schwab in favor of a plan to build a 1,500 meter long runway on the base that was dropped in past negotiations between the U.S. and the previous Liberal Democratic Party-led government. The relocating of Futemma is pegged to be completed by 2014, but within the Democratic Party of Japan's (DPJ) tripartite factions there is a vast gulf between opinions. The People's New Party (PNP) proposes to consolidate Futemma's heliport functions into the U.S. Air Force's Kadena Air Base nearby, or alternatively to transfer them to Camp Schwab. However the Social Democratic Party (SDP), maintains it wants the relocation site to be outside Okinawa or outside of Japan completely, citing the U.S. territory of Guam as a possible option and has said that it would quit the ruling coalition if the government decides to keep the base on Okinawa. SDP chief Mizuho Fukushima told reporters Friday, "I understand that the Nago mayor, the people in Nago, and those in Okinawa Prefecture think moving the facility to either the coastal area or the inland area is not an option." Hatoyama has a self-imposed deadline of the end of May to determine the immediate future of the U.S. Marine Corps Futemma Air Station, meanwhile Washington's latest stance on the relocation issues, amid the recent controversy, remains unclear, although on numerous occasions recently, Washington has called for Tokyo to abide by the existing 2006 agreement.For all the talk of Sarah Palin these days, there are two Republicans who are already laying the groundwork to run for president in 2012 -- Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota and Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts. Both appeared before a crowd of influential conservatives this week to offer a portrait of how they plan to run against President Barack Obama, and seek to harness the surge of energy from the Tea Party movement, which tends to be suspicious of establishment Republicans like them. Romney and Pawlenty offered full-throated endorsements of the positions of most concern to attendees at the Conservative Political Action Conference. They attacked Obama, saying that he had tried to foist a big-spending government on an unreceptive public, that he was weak in his dealings with foreign leaders, and that he was coddling terrorism suspects. Romney went so far as to present Obama as a failed president. Yet there were differences between these two men that emerged over two days and gave the party a chance to compare them. Romney made little or no mention of social issues, like abortion or same-sex marriage, after having taken intense criticism during the 2008 campaign for moving rightward to head off conservatives' concerns. But Pawlenty offered supportive language that was well understood by opponents of abortion and same-sex marriage, talking about "the sanctity of life" and "traditional marriages." He also rejected any kind of secular view of government as he listed "four ideas that I think should carry us forward." "The first one is this: God's in charge," he said. "There are some people who say, 'Oh, you know, Pawlenty, don't bring that up. You know it's politically incorrect.' Hogwash." Aside from a few activists and the Revolutionary War re-enactor who has become a regular at Tea Party events, as well as mainstream Republican leaders who have embraced the movement, the Tea Party may have been here more in spirit than numbers. Yet Romney and Pawlenty are well aware of Palin's appeal to the Tea Party movement, and they went to great lengths to cast their lots with this new power. When he spoke on Thursday, Romney was introduced by Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts, who captured his seat with significant Tea Party backing last month, a victory that made him something of a hero here.Ambitious host Canada clinched opening victory at the Vancouver Olympic men's ice hockey tournament here on Tuesday. Dany Heatley and Jarome Iginla scored twice each to lead the Canadian to sweep Norway 8-0 in a Group A match at the Canada Hockey Place. Assisted by "Golden Boy" Sidney Crosby, Iginla broke the deadlock for Canada two minutes and a half into the second period. "After the first goal, we started getting more shots. You have to make sure you're still focused and have shots in the right areas," Iginla said. "When it was three, four, five, we just kept pushing it. We need those goals, you don't know how it's going to turn out." In the other preliminary Group A clash, the United States beat Switzerland 3-1. In the women's category, Jenny Potter of the United States became the first female ice hockey player to score hat tricks in two consecutive Olympic matches when she contributed three goals in a 13-0 preliminary Group B victory over Russia while Finland came from behind to defeat China 2-1. The Americans and Finland have both secured their berths in top four with two preliminary wins with Russia and China being sent to 5th-8th deciders.The Dubai police chief said on Thursday he wants the head of Mossad to be arrested if the agency is behind the killing of a Hamas militant in the Gulf emirate, in an interview with Dubai TV. "If the Mossad were proven to be behind the crime, which is most likely now, Interpol should issue a Red Notice for the head of the Mossad (Meir Dagan) because he would be a killer," Lieutenant General Dahi Khalfan said in an interview that will be aired later on Thursday. Red Notices are "to seek the arrest or provisional arrest of wanted persons with a view to extradition," according to the Interpol website. Mahmud al-Mabhuh, one of the founders of Hamas's military wing, was found dead in his Dubai hotel room on January 20. Earlier on Thursday, Interpol issued Red Notices for 11 suspects in Mabhuh's killing. Khalfan released this week the photos and names of the 11 European passport holders -- six from Britain, three from Ireland, one from Germany and one from France -- that he suspects of being members of the hit squad. "Our investigations reveal that Mossad is involved in the murder of Mabhuh. It is 99 percent, if not 100 percent that Mossad is standing behind the murder," The National, an Abu Dhabi-based daily, quoted Khalfan as saying Thursday. At its Lyon, France headquarters, Interpol said it had not issued a Red Notice for Degan.Canada's world champion Christine Nesbitt took gold in the women's 1,000-metres speedskating Thursday, holding off a powerful Dutch challenge to win the host nation's third gold of the Games. Nesbitt was off the pace early on but backed by a passionate home crowd roared back to seize first place in a time of 1min 16.56secs, just 0.02secs ahead of Annette Gerritsen. Laurine van Riessen took bronze with 1:16.72. Skating in the second-to-last pair, Nesbitt faced a nervous wait for the final pair of Canada's Kristina Groves and Margot Boer of the Netherlands to race at the Richmond Olympic Oval before she could celebrate Olympic gold. "I knew I wasn't skating good. It wasn't coming easy. The first 600m wasn't good. It happened to me before, but in the last leg I kept fighting and I knew it paid off," Nesbitt said. "I can't believe it's the Olympics, it doesn't feel real," the 24-year-old added. She said the support of the crowd was a major factor. "I was not nervous at all. They were cheering me on and it made a big difference." Silver medallist Gerritsen said she was delighted with her second-placed finish despite failing to win gold by a wafer-thin margin. "It's great. Two days ago it was disappointing. Now it's beautiful," she said. "I have trained so long for this and I have been looking forward to this for such a long time. I thought it has to happen now. It is a dream come true," she added. "It's only two-hundredths of a second, but I am so happy. Happiness tops disappointment," she said. Dutch team-mate Van Riessen said: "This is awesome. It's really cool. I didn't think it would be enough. I am really close to the first position but I am happy to be third." Reigning women's world 1,000-metre speedskating champion Nesbitt was returning to the 400-metre oval where she captured her world crown. Nesbitt owns the fastest time in the event this season at 1:13.36 and the reigning World Cup champion is also four-for-four in World Cup 1,000m races this season. Australia-born Nesbitt began as a short-track speedskater but when she was not accepted at McGill University in Montreal, the home of Canada's short-track programme, she switched to the long-track group in Calgary. She took a 2006 Olympic silver medal in team pursuit.Two US astronauts from the space shuttle Endeavour prepared to unveil a room with an out-of-this-world view in the third spacewalk of their mission to attach a new room to the International Space Station. At 9:30 pm Tuesday (0215 GMT Wednesday), US astronaut Bob Behnken and his British colleague Nicholas Patrick began the final walk of their mission, which will see them complete installation of the Tranquility node and the seven- windowed cupola attached to it. The walk is expected to take 6.5 hours and began with the pair hooking Tranquility up to ammonia loops that allow coolant to flow into the module and installing heater and data cables. The two spacewalkers will then remove insulation from the cupola's seven windows and release launch locks. Inside, Endeavour's pilot, Terry Virts, will finally be able to open the cupola's window shutters, revealing for the first time the panoramic view. The room's seven windows are expected to provide a breathtaking view of space, Earth and visiting spacecraft, while the 360-degree viewing spectrum provides a vital access point for monitoring spacewalks and docking operations. While the spacewalkers work, Japanese astronaut Soichi Noguchi will move a workstation from the Destiny laboratory in the International Space Station to prepare it for installation inside the cupola. The cupola can accommodate two people at a time and will be equipped with portable workstations that can control station and robotic activities. The Tranquility module and its seven-pane bay window were built in Italy by Thales Alenia Space for NASA and are the last major components for the station. With the new room in place, the space station is now about 90 percent complete. Endeavour is due to end its mission on February 21. The mission, one of just five remaining for NASA's three shuttles before the program ends later this year after a 29-year run, comes as the US space agency re-evaluates its future after President Barack Obama effectively abandoned a US plan to send astronauts back to the moon by 2020. Constrained by soaring deficits, Obama submitted a budget to Congress that encourages NASA to focus instead on developing commercial transport alternatives to ferry astronauts to the ISS after the shuttle program ends. The ISS, a joint project involving 16 countries, has cost around 100 billion dollars, mostly funded by the United States. Under Obama's new budget, the orbiting research station could see its life extended by five years until 2020. NASA has set the next shuttle mission, by Discovery, for March 18.American Idol, the runaway television success which has enjoyed an American ratings stranglehold for almost six years, was knocked off top spot by the US Winter Olympic team's triple gold medal sweep on Wednesday. Figures showed that NBC's coverage of the Games attracted 30.1 million viewers in the 9-10 o'clock slot compared to the 18.4 million who tuned in to see American Idol on rival network Fox. It is the first time that American Idol, now in its ninth season, has been beaten in US ratings since May 2004. "US figures just out show the NBC coverage was in the top spot last night in the 9-10 segment. 30.1 million watched Vancouver as opposed to 18.4 that watched American Idol, so knocked American Idol off the top spot," said International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams. "I'm told that's nearly 12 million more people than a similar day at the 2006 Winter Games, so they are some very significant figures." The US team at the Winter Olympics celebrated three golds on Wednesday with Lindsey Vonn in skiing, Shaun White in snowboarding and Shani Davis in the 1,000m speedskate.Maria Riesch of Germany produced a storming slalom performance to win the women's super-combined gold at the Vancouver Winter Olympics on Thursday. American Julia Mancuso won the silver and Anja Paerson of Sweden took the bronze after race leader Lindsey Vonn crashed in the second, slalom leg of the two- discipline event. Vonn, who made history Wednesday by winning the United States' first ever Olympic gold in the women's downhill, went into the slalom with a 0.33sec lead on Riesch. However, the 25-year-old crashed just before the halfway mark, handing Riesch, who had taken provisional top spot after a stellar performance down Franz's Run, her first Olympic gold medal. Reigning Olympic slalom champion Paerson picked up her second consecutive bronze from the combined event. After a spectacular crash in the women's downhill Wednesday, the 29-year-old Swede dusted herself off to produce a solid first leg downhill performance that left her only 1.41 behind Vonn going into the slalom. Mancuso picks up her second silver medal of the Games, having stunned the field to take downhill silver behind Vonn. The reigning giant slalom champion from Turin in 2006, Mancuso now has three Olympic medals.Walter Smith says his side will take nothing for granted after Rangers opened up a commanding 10-point lead at the top of the Scottish Premier League on Sunday. The Ibrox side took advantage of Celtic's 4-4 draw away to Aberdeen to restore their double figure gap at the top of the table with a 3-0 win over third-placed Hibernian at Ibrox on Sunday. Just four days earlier Celtic had reduced the gap to eight points when Rangers could only manage a 1-1 draw against Motherwell. And while Smith is delighted to have regained a 10-point lead he says the league race is far from over and believes more points could be dropped by both sides in the title run-in. "Everyone makes these assumptions all the time. We just carry on and I think that's the sensible thing to do," said Smith. "When you look at last week it is typical of what might happen. People don't give enough credit to the other teams in Scotland. They think it's an easy thing for the Old Firm to win games - it's not. "We are delighted to have a 10-point gap but when you get three points for a win then you know the consequences of not winning. "So from our own point of view nothing should be taken for granted and I don't think we would do that given what has already happened this season." The Ibrox club's clean sheet against Hibs was their tenth of the season in the league and they have conceded 13 fewer than second-placed Celtic. And Smith said it is his side's strong defensive showing that could clinch them their second title in a row this season. "I think any team that wins the league championship has to have a decent defensive record. I don't think there is any doubt about that," the Rangers manager said. "Unless you score a remarkable amount of goals then that is always going to be the case. "From our own point of view our boys have defended solidly but I think at times we have played better than a lot of people have given us credit for." The Rangers manager was backed by his defender Steven Whittaker, who opened the scoring against his former club Hibs. "We have managed to keep it tight at the back and we haven't been conceding goals," the right-back said. "We went through a spell when we were not scoring except for December when we scored a lot. "But with Kris Boyd and Kenny Miller back now I'm sure the goals will start coming and as long as we can keep the clean sheets at the back then I'm sure we'll do well." At Ibrox Whittaker gave Rangers the lead five minutes into the second-half when he curled an excellent shot into the top left-hand corner of Graeme Smith's net. Kris Boyd then scored his 21st goal of the season from the penalty spot after Kenny Miller had been felled before Miller himself scored a third in injury time as he tapped in past Smith with Hibs substitute Kevin McBride lying injured on the deck.Here is a list of meetings between the Dalai Lama and the US president at the White House over the past 10 years, as Tibet's spiritual leader meets Barack Obama on Thursday. - May 23, 2001: President George W. Bush welcomes the Dalai Lama to the White House, the first such meeting in eight years. Renewing the tradition set by his father George H. W. Bush in 1991, Bush holds the talks in the presidential residence, as Beijing celebrates the 50th anniversary of the annexation of Tibet. Bush's predecessor Bill Clinton had met the Dalai Lama on several occasions, but only by "dropping by" meetings with other officials, notably vice president Al Gore. - September 10, 2003: George W. Bush again meets the Dalai Lama in the residential area of the White House and not in the Oval Office, the seat of American executive power. A similar meeting takes place on November 9, 2005. - October 17, 2007: The president and the US Congress pay an unprecedented homage to the Dalai Lama, defying China's angry objections. For the first time a US president appears in public alongside the Dalai Lama. Bush awards him the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award bestowed by the US legislature during a grand ceremony on Capitol Hill.Norway's Emil Hegle Svendsen won the Olympic Games men's 20km biathlon title on Thursday. Belarus's Sergey Novikov and Norway's and Ole Einar Bjoerndalen shared silver in a dead heat.Maria Riesch of Germany won the women's super-combined gold at the Vancouver Winter Olympics on Thursday. American Julia Mancuso took the silver and Anja Paerson of Sweden the bronze after race leader Lindsey Vonn crashed in the slalom.Tibet's exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama appeared in public at the White House Thursday and said US President Barack Obama was "supportive" in a meeting that drew angry protests from China.Former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said Tuesday that the federal government will be repaid in full for the funds it put into the country's lenders. "We will get every penny we put into the banks back" and turn a profit, Paulson said at a meeting of the Greater Omaha Chamber in Omaha, Neb. "I think when you look at all the other programs, we may be surprised at what we get back." More than 700 U.S. banks, insurers and credit card companies applied to the government for cash from the Treasury's $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program. Borrowers including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo have returned more than $180 billion in bailout funds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A government watchdog monitoring the bailout said last month TARP will cost taxpayers less than previously predicted. An earlier report from Special Inspector General Neil Barofsky to Congress predicted the final cost could be "substantial." Paulson in 2008 injected capital into banks in exchange for preferred shares paying 5 percent and warrants to buy common stock. Paulson was responding to a question from billionaire Warren Buffett. Buffett and Paulson appeared on stage together at an event to promote Paulson's book, "On the Brink." "I think you're right," Buffett said when Paulson said the U.S. would recoup its investment. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is based in Omaha. Buffett declined to comment after the event Tuesday. Paulson wrote in the book published last week that a proposal from Buffett helped him hone the bailout to make it palatable to investors. During a private phone call late on Oct. 11, 2008, Buffett suggested charging banks 5 percent or 6 percent on the U.S. investments and raising the rate later, Paulson wrote. The Treasury team had been considering 7 percent or 8 percent. "I was convinced Warren's was the best way to make the capital purchase program attractive to banks while giving them an incentive to pay back the government," Paulson wrote. "Warren had a vested interest in this idea. But the truth was I was looking for an approach just like his: an investor-friendly plan that would protect the taxpayer" and encourage private investment. Buffett's Berkshire is the biggest investor in Goldman Sachs Group and Wells Fargo. His $5 billion investment in New York-based Goldman Sachs came on September 23, 2008, a week after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc..

Former Great Britain hooker Newton has been suspended by the UK Anti-Doping agency (UKAD) after testing positive for a prohibited substance following a random test during pre-season training. Newton, who is just two games into his career with Wakefield, is the second high profile Super League player to fail a drugs test in the last 12 months. Wigan and England second row forward Gareth Hock was handed a two-year ban after testing positive for cocaine in August. Cullen, now coaching Championship club Widnes Vikings, says the Rugby Football League (RFL) should step up their efforts to eradicate the problem from the sport. "I've been involved in this game for many, many years and unfortunately I think these type of issues are only the tip of the iceberg," Cullen told Sky Sports. "I can't prove it but I think we should create more testing. We've introduced blood testing as opposed to urine testing, which we believe is far more thorough, and hopefully that's going to frighten the cheats to death. "I think we should have mandatory, not random, tests for every single player in our sport, starting at Super League level; blood tests regularly through the season and random testing on top. "The cost is irrelevant. We've got to get rid of this problem in our sport. "I'm not staggered by this news. I'm fully dejected by it and I'm angry and bitterly disappointed that we have players in our game that think they can get away with it. "We need a moral compass within our sport and that's why I say we have to test more often and more vigorously and present as clean a sport as we possibly can."The Celtics did not have Paul Pierce (foot strain) available Wednesday night. But Pierce's replacement, Tony Allen, was there to provide the key play as the Celtics took a 107-102 victory over the Miami Heat at TD Garden. Allen and the rest of the Celtics struggled against Dwyane Wade (30 points, 13 assists), but Allen batted away Wade's dribble and converted two foul shots for a 99-94 lead with 36.5 seconds remaining. That gave the Celtics enough breathing room to trade free throws for Heat 2-pointers. The Celtics were 11 for 13 from the line in the final 1:22. The Celtics led by 10 points midway through the final quarter. But the Heat came back behind the 3-point shooting of Wade and Quentin Richardson, plus the inside play of Udonis Haslem. Miami twice cut the deficit to 2, and had a chance to pull within 1 as Wade missed a banker with the Celtics leading, 97-94. Rajon Rondo (22 points, 14 assists) led the way for the Celtics, who have won two straight after losing three in a row.President Barack Obama met with the Dalai Lama on Thursday, welcoming the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader to the White House for a low-profile meeting that nonetheless raised the hackles of China. The two men spoke about democracy, human rights and the need to preserve Tibet's religious identity and culture -- all issues that, predictably, irritated Beijing. In a written statement after the meeting, the White House said Obama had expressed support for the preservation of Tibet's "unique religious, cultural and linguistic identity and the protection of human rights for Tibetans in the People's Republic of China." The meeting, which the White House put off last year so as not to interfere with Obama's trip to Beijing in November, is the latest evidence of the more muscular posture that the Obama administration has been adopting with China, after a year in which China has taken a firm stance with the United States on a number of issues. Last month, the administration announced a $6 billion arms sales package to Taiwan, infuriating Chinese officials. The meeting on Thursday between Obama and the Dalai Lama did not go over well with Chinese officials, either. China, which regards the Dalai Lama as an advocate of Tibetan independence, condemned the meeting, saying that it was "strongly dissatisfied" and that it expected the United States to try to make amends. The spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Ma Zhaoxu, said the meeting "violated the U.S. government's repeated acceptance that Tibet is a part of China and it does not support Tibetan independence," the official Xinhua news agency reported. While the White House took pains to avoid the appearance that this was a meeting between two heads of state -- it took place, for instance, in the White House Map Room, not in the Oval Office -- the Dalai Lama also met with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton at the State Department. The White House sought to keep the meeting low-key. White House officials did not allow reporters or photographers to see Obama and the Dalai Lama together, and they released a single official photograph after the meeting. In deference to China, U.S. presidents usually do not meet publicly with the Dalai Lama. President George W. Bush broke with that tradition in 2007, though, when he attended a ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda in which Congress bestowed upon the Dalai Lama the Congressional Gold Medal.French luxury group PPR said Thursday that it will maintain Alexander McQueen's label after the British designer committed suicide last week. "This would be the best tribute that we could offer to him," said Francois-Henri Pinault, president of the group, at a meeting in Paris to present company results. The flamboyant 40-year-old McQueen, one of Britain's most lauded designers, hanged himself in his London apartment on February 11 after leaving a note. He was said to have been emotionally distraught after his mother died on February 2 and had posted Twitter comments a few days before his death about his "awful week." Pinault said in Paris that the decision to maintain the label was taken quickly after the announcement of McQueen's death and that the fashion house continued to hold "very important potential." The label Alexander McQueen is part of the Gucci group, owned by PPR, and has 11 boutiques from New York to London. It employs 180 people worldwide. Gucci Group chief executive Robert Polet said McQueen had acquired solid brand recognition over the past years. McQueen's team of creators will finish work on a new collection that will be presented in Paris on March 9, he said. Pinault opened the meeting on Thursday by paying an emotional tribute to McQueen, saying he had lost a "friend" and describing him as "highly sensitive" and "a unique individual whom we are missing terribly." From a humble background, McQueen rose to become one of Britain's most acclaimed names in fashion, becoming the chief designer for Givenchy in 1996 before moving on to his own label. Gucci bought a majority stake in his label in 2001 but McQueen retained creative control and went on to win four British designer of the year awards. According to Gucci, the label went into profit in 2007, but it is considered a lightweight in comparison to the group's leading brands, Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent. Over the past days, sales of McQueen's clothes and accessories have surged, as fashion fans rush to grab mementos. Flamboyant US pop star Lady Gaga was a McQueen fan and had recently donned his towering lobster claw shoes for one of her music videos. At a British awards show on Tuesday, she took to the stage to perform her song "Telephone" and told the audience: "This is for Alexander McQueen."Sweden's seven-time world champion Anja Paerson is uncertain to start in the women's Olympic super-combined after suffering severe bruising in a spectacular crash in Wednesday's downhill. Paerson was racing to a silver medal when she landed awkwardly after flying higher than she would have liked off the final jump "Hot Air", before crashing out of the race. Although a hospital scan revealed no serious injuries, a team spokesman said the 29-year-old's participation in Thursday's super-combined was in doubt. "For the moment it's 50-50," team spokesman Camilla Sandy told AFP. "Anja has bruising on her left leg, on her thigh and has a sore calf. The soreness on her calf seems to be the main problem. "A decision on whether she will race tomorrow will only be taken in the morning (Thursday). Maybe she will go up on the hill first to see how she feels." After misjudging the jump Paerson slid across the finish line ski-less and had to receive medical attention before leaving with a doctor. She was the highest-profile casualty in a race which, despite featuring several spectacular crashes, was described by several racers as the "perfect" Olympic downhill. Nevertheless, International Ski Federation (FIS) officials said they will immediately start work on shaving the final jump for the shorter downhill section of Thursday's race. Paerson's coach Ulf Emilsson said after the crash: "If you see the crash, it's amazing that she can actually walk. She is happy to have survived as well as she did. "If you know Paerson like I do, you know she'll probably be back." Downhill winner Lindsey Vonn of the United States said she hoped Paerson, a rival in Thursday's super-combined, would recover. "She went 60 metres, which is unbelievable," she said. "I hope she can still compete, I wish her all the best." Since winning her first Olympic title, in the slalom at Turin in 2006, Paerson has struggled to keep pace with Vonn in the World Cup series. However, this season the 29-year-old all-rounder from the remote town of Tarnaby, the birthplace of alpine legend Ingemar Stenmark, has come fighting back. Paerson has claimed six podiums, notching up her first win in timely fashion, in the super-combined, at St. Moritz two weeks ago. She is also third overall in the World Cup behind Vonn and Riesch, third in the downhill standings and only 10 points behind super-combined leader Vonn.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei said Wednesday that U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spreads lies about Iran in the Persian Gulf region, the semi-official Fars news agency reported. "Now, once again the Americans, have dispatched their agent to the Persian Gulf to repeat the usual lies," Khamenei was quoted as saying. Clinton warned in Doha on Monday that Iran is "moving toward a military dictatorship," saying that "the Revolutionary Guard, we believe, in fact, is supplanting the government of Iran." "We are planning to bring the world community together to impose pressure on Iran through sanctions adopted by the United Nations," she added. Khamenei said "But nobody believes such words. The reason is the United States is not interested in the interests of the nations in the region." He also said "The United States has turned the Persian Gulf into the arms depot and invaded Iraq and Afghanistan... and in such a context spreads lies against Iran," according to Fars. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Tuesday that he did not take U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's words seriously. Tehran reiterated its displeasure with what Tehran says the West's attempts to back Iranian opposition and to destabilize the country.American Lindsey Vonn won the women's downhill gold at the Winter Olympics on Wednesday. Team-mate Julia Mancuso took the silver with Austrian Elisabeth Goergl winning the bronze.On the eve of the men's free skate, one that promises to be one of the closest, most exciting in Olympic history, the top six skaters practiced together Wednesday. Each was dressed from head to toe in black. Each wore a steely look, running through his long program. But Russia's Evgeni Plushenko, the defending Olympic champion known for his cool confidence, was the only one to stop for an extended time to survey the competition. "He has one major advantage over everyone -- and that's the Olympic gold medal," said the American Evan Lysacek, the reigning world champion who is in second place. "He has power mentally because he has what we all want. And so I think it's going to take some mighty fine skating to get that power away from him." Plushenko, 27, is trying to become the first man since Dick Button in 1952 to repeat as Olympic champion. But there are several men with a legitimate chance to stop him. The top three skaters are nearly tied. Lysacek is 0.55 of a point behind Plushenko. Japan's Daisuke Takahashi, is in third, just 0.6 of a point back. The difference may come down to which skaters perform cleanly -- and which try the quadruple jump, the risky move that involves four full revolutions in the air. The last time an Olympic champion won without a quad was 1994, and Plushenko says any skater who does not try it is setting the sport back. Plushenko landed his quad during the short program, but neither Lysacek nor Takahashi tried one. If landed cleanly, that jump garners more points than any other single jump the men's skaters are doing right now. In the free skate, both Plushenko and Takahashi say they will incorporate the move. Even Johnny Weir, the American who is in sixth place, said he might try the quad, too. "Without quadruples, I don't know, sorry, but it's not men," Plushenko said after his short program. "It's not men's figure skating." But Lysacek, who fell on the quad in his free skate at U.S. nationals last month, is not bothered by all the pro-quad trash talk. He is still planning to leave it out. And he is still confident that he could win, based on his strengths: dazzling footwork, passionate interpretation of the music and stunning spins. After his short program, he sobbed afterward because his performance had gone just as he had planned. Even without the quad, he ended up on Plushenko's tail. Lysacek's coach, Frank Carroll, said Lysacek could still shine as bright as the others Thursday. "It doesn't seem to me like the quad made all that much difference," Carroll said of the short program. "My boy made a mistake in one of his spins and got a level three. If he got a level four, he would have won the short. It's a matter of apples and oranges. What do you think is more important? The spins, the footwork, the steps, the skating skills? Or whether you think jumping is the forte. I think that's what it boils down to here."The new Honduran government of President Porfirio Lobo has restored diplomatic ties with 29 countries that broke with Tegucigalpa following the June 2009 coup, the country's foreign minister said Sunday. There are still 10 countries that have not restored ties with Tegucigalpa, Foreign Minister Mario Canahuati said in an interview with the daily El Tiempo. Honduras was internationally isolated following a military supported coup on June 28, 2009 that saw then-president Manuel Zelaya ousted at gunpoint and put on a plane in pajamas. Zelaya sneaked back into Tegucigalpa in September and took up refuge in the Brazilian embassy, but failed in his attempt at reinstatement. Lobo was elected in a November election set up under the de facto regime of Roberto Micheletti. He took office on January 27 and granted Zelaya safe passage out of the country, agreeing not to arrest him over charges he violated the constitution while in power. France, Spain, Italy, Guatemala and Germany have since restored ties with Honduras, Canahuati said earlier. However ties with countries that include Brazil, Mexico, and leftist nations including Venezuela and Nicaragua have yet to be restored, Canahuati told El Tiempo.China lost its best chance to win a speed skating Olympic gold at the Vancouver Winter Games as top sprinter Wang Beixing finished third in the women's 500m event here on Tuesday. The 24-year-old said she was half happy and half disappointed, but she would never give up chasing the dream. South Korean Lee Sang-Hwa edged world record holder Jenny Wolf from Germany by 0.05 seconds to collect the second speed skating gold for South Korea at the Olympic Winter Games while Wang's result of 76.63 seconds in two races was 0.47 seconds behind the 31-year-old German. "I have to say that I'm 50 percent disappointed because I failed to win the gold," said Wang, who will also compete in the 1,000m event but gets far fewer chances to achieve. "However, I'm still 50 percent happy for myself because it's the first time I stand on the Olympic podium." At the 2006 Turin Olympic Winter Games, three-time veteran Wang Manli was so close to making the breakthrough but failed to show her sharpest form due to highly-burden pressure. When the 33 -year-old ace took the silver in the women's 500m race, her 12 -year-old younger teammate Wang Beixing made a reasonable seventh finish. Four years later, Wang becomes the hot favourite to continue the Chinese speed skaters' pursue as she collected several World Cup victories and was only behind Wolf at last year's World Championships. After finishing the first race in 38.48 seconds, Wang was ranked behind Lee and Wolf. She managed to improve her result to 38.14 seconds, but both Lee and Wolf skated into 38 seconds as the last pair in the second race. "I performed better in the second race," said Wang, who tried to keep smiling all along during the interview. "My skating was a little bit tight in the first run. I wasn't relaxed enough. Both Lee and Wolf skated excellently today, especially Lee." Unlike the German veteran Wolf who is really aggressive during competition, a low-key Wang is more like a delicate and amicable college girl. However, when she skated on the ice, her whizzing speed is threatening. Her personal best is only 0.02 seconds slower that the world record of 37.00 held by Wolf. In the opinion of Ye Qiaobo, who grabbed Chinese speed skating's first Olympic medal in 1992, the Chinese hopeful needs to be more aggressive and open. But Wang didn't agree that her character was an obstacle for her achievements. "I just try my best every time and that's enough," said Wang. "Of course I won't give up. I will definitely compete at the next Olympic Games."President Obama's failure to meet the Dalai Lama last year set back the Tibetan cause, but a new meeting at the White House this week is a chance for the president to repair the damage, according to a top aide to the exiled leader. The Dalai Lama is to meet Thursday with Obama. China has criticized the meeting and warned of unspecified consequences. Obama postponed that initial meeting last year because of his concerns about China's reaction. The new meeting is "an excellent opportunity for America as a nation and for Obama as an American president to really reinforce the values that you cherish," the Dalai Lama's special envoy, Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari, said in an interview Tuesday. "You should be proud of that, not hesitant about that." For its part, the Obama administration seems to have planned the get-together in such a way as to both honor the Tibetan leader and avoid enraging Beijing. While Obama won't meet the Dalai Lama in public, as former President Bush did in 2008 when the Dalai Lama was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, Obama will host him in the West Wing, and not the White House's private quarters as President Clinton used to do. The meeting, which comes on the heels of a decision to sell China's nemesis Taiwan $6.4 billion in weapons, will take place in the Map Room; no president has ever met with the Dalai Lama in the Oval Office. Last summer, with a summit approaching with China in November, Obama decided to postpone a meeting with the Dalai Lama. That decision marked the first time since 1991 that an American president had declined to host the exiled Tibetan leader during one of his occasional trips to Washington. U.S. officials explained their decision as part of a series of moves aimed at setting a good foundation for relations with China. Washington was seeking Chinese assistance in countering nuclear proliferation from North Korea, securing an agreement on climate change, getting support in dealing with the global financial crisis and cooperation in confronting Iran's alleged nuclear weapons program. The administration also wanted China to resume talks with representatives of the Dalai Lama, who fled China in 1959 after an abortive anti-Chinese uprising. Those talks with China _ the ninth round since 2002 _ did resume in January when Gyari led a delegation to China for five days. The results so far are inconclusive, Gyari said. China has also recently concluded the first significant Communist Party and government meeting on Tibet since 2003. The meeting appeared to be a tacit acknowledgment that China's policies in the region have not won China much support among Tibetans. Anti-Chinese riots and demonstrations swept through many Tibetan areas in the spring of 2008. During the meetings China pledged an additional $60 billion in development funds for Tibetan regions. Briefing reporters and analysts, Gyari provided new insights into Obama's decision last year. He stressed that the Dalai Lama agreed with Obama's decision but that "we had a lot of misgivings." Gyari said he was concerned China would interpret the decision as a sign of American weakness and an opportunity to redouble pressure on other countries to cut their ties to the exiled Tibetan government. The decision would "give an easy way out for a lot of weakling countries, sitting on the fence" about their support for the Dalai Lama, Gyari said. He noted that China suspended diplomatic ties with Denmark after its prime minister met the Dalai Lama and resumed them in December only after the Danish government promised to check with Beijing before inviting him again. "Unfortunately, it had definitely created setbacks for us on that score," Gyari said. Gyari also said he was worried Tibetans in China would view Obama's decision as a defeat for the Dalai Lama that could contribute to a "devastating" drop in morale. "Our intentions were noble," he said, "but I think it was misread by the Chinese. ... It is my hope that this meeting will help overcome these concerns."FC Porto will host injury-hit Arsenal on Wednesday in the round-of-16 in the Champions League. Recent defeats against rivals Manchester United and Chelsea raised questions about Arsenal's title credentials, with the team looking especially vulnerable against counterattacks and set pieces. Arsenal has also been hit by injuries and will be without Eduardo da Silva, Andrey Arshavin, Alex Song, Manuel Almunia and William Gallas after they were omitted from an 18-man squad that departed for Portugal on Tuesday. Porto, a two-time European champion, is into the last 16 for the sixth time in seven seasons. Last season, Porto beat Arsenal 2-0 in Portugal in the group phase.Mika Poutala of Finland leads after the first round of the men's 500-meter speedskating at the Richmond Olympic Oval. Poutala finished in 34.86 seconds. Mo Tae-bum of South Korea was next in 34.92, followed by Joji Kato of Japan at 34.93. Canadian favorite Jeremy Wotherspoon was fifth (35.09). A second race is being held later this evening, with the total time determining the winner. The session already was delayed by about an hour because of a problem with the ice-resurfacing machines midway through the first race.Saudi Arabia fueled doubts on Tuesday about whether it backs new UN sanctions to end the Iran nuclear crisis, as US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton prepared to return home. Clinton defended the US-led push for tougher sanctions when she again charged that "evidence doesn't support" Iran's assertion that it is pursuing a peaceful atomic programme. US officials travelling with Clinton on the mission to drum up support for tougher action against Iran expressed satisfaction and said they were "very pleased" following her lengthy talks with King Abdullah on Monday. But Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal raised some doubt about Riyadh's support for further sanctions against Tehran when he termed the measures as a "long-term solution." "We see the issue in the shorter term because we are closer to the threat ... We need an immediate resolution," Saud told journalists said after meeting Clinton. It was not immediately clear whether Saud was calling for a tough and immediate UN Security Council resolution or another solution to the perceived threat from Iran. On Tuesday, a Saudi foreign policy official stressed that Riyadh was not advocating military action but rather a linkage with the Middle East peace process as a faster and more effective means to ease regional tensions. "There is no point in our spending all our time on sanctions which will not have an effect in the short term. We need something more tangible," he said, asking not to be identified. "We don't want a military strike ... A military strike, we still believe, will be very counter-productive. "We need to do something on Israel and the Palestinians ... For instance, the US could get Israel to halt (Jewish) settlements" on the occupied West Bank. "There is a credibility issue with the US administration on promises it cannot fulfill," he said, referring to the stalled peace process. Clinton's tour of Qatar and Saudi Arabia aimed to isolate Iran from its Arab neighbours and to put pressure on China to drop its resistance to UN sanctions targeting mainly Iran's Revolutionary Guards. Last week, Iran began enriching uranium to 20 percent purity, which Washington and other capitals say adds to evidence it is seeking a nuclear weapon. Tehran denies the charge, insisting its goal is peaceful nuclear energy and research. Prince Saud played down suggestions that the oil-rich kingdom could prod Beijing not to block sanctions against Tehran by guaranteeing Beijing stable oil supplies in the event of disruption from Iran. However, he said China, which invests heavily in and imports much of its oil from Iran, "carries its responsibilities" within the Security Council where it holds a veto power. "And they need no suggestion from Saudi Arabia to do what they ought to do," Prince Saud added. At the Monday night press conference, the Saudi chief diplomat also appeared to endorse Clinton's charge, which she made earlier the same day, that Iran was turning into a "military dictatorship." The Revolutionary Guards were "supplanting" the clerical and political leadership in Tehran with a more radical line, she said. Saud said he was inclined to believe her warnings on the Revolutionary Guards. Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki hit back on Tuesday, saying Clinton had tried but failed to dupe Gulf Arab states about a threat from the Islamic republic. Clinton was in the Saudi Red Sea city of Jeddah on Tuesday on the last part of her three-day tour, also aimed at gaining support for Washington's push for a resumption of peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. In Jeddah, she met with the head of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, the world's largest pan-Islamic grouping, introducing the new US envoy to the group. She also held a "town hall" meeting at the elite private women's college Dar al- Hekma, where she was hailed as the world's "most popular woman." Clinton told students that "evidence doesn't support" Iran's claim it has peaceful nuclear aims, and warned them if Iran is allowed to pursue its programme unchecked, it could set off a nuclear arms race in the region. She said that if Iran gets a nuclear weapon "then other countries which feel threatened by Iran will say to themselves 'if Iran has a nuclear weapon, I'd better get one too in order to protect my people.' Then you have a nuclear arms race in the region. Then you all kinds of opportunities for problems that could be quite dangerous."Flamboyant US superstar Lady Gaga scooped three awards Tuesday at the 30th anniversary edition of Britain's top music awards the Brits, in a night of triumph for female artists. The eccentric New Yorker was awarded all three prizes she was nominated for, including best international female solo artist and international breakthrough act. Sporting a lace outfit with a huge white wig and mask at the London ceremony, she also picked up the award for best international album for The Fame. Picking up the award for her album, the tearful star said:"I was really excited to win the first two awards. This award means even more to me because I worked so hard on this album for so long. "My fans were the first people to believe in me. Thank you so much." The 23-year-old, who dedicated the night to fashion designer Alexander McQueen who died last week, led the way in a night of success for female artists. British singer Lily Allen was named best British female solo artist and another homegrown talent, Florence And the Machine -- the stage name for singer Florence Welch -- picked up best British album. Other stars to pick up awards at the ceremony included rapper Jay-Z and British singer Robbie Williams.There might be a connection, or there might not be. Truth to tell, it's probably just a coincidence, but it's an intriguing one nonetheless. Julia Mancuso became a world-class skier because of the wealth of experience she gained as a kid on the formidable, fabled slopes at Squaw Valley, Calif. Whistler, in turn, became a world-class ski resort because of the wonderful experiences Franz Wilhelmsen and his friends had when they attended the 1960 Winter Olympics at Squaw Valley. The men returned to Vancouver thoroughly jazzed, determined to transform this remote summer fishing camp into a Games-worthy venue. Of course, people thought they were nuts. But the dream would be realized 50 years later, long after Wilhemsen had passed away. Sadly, he died a couple years before Whistler learned it would be the host of the 2010 Olympics. Anyway, along comes Mancuso, the erstwhile Squaw Valley snow bunny, hanging on to her career by the slimmest of threads, nursing a finicky back and hip and, because of same, a seemingly fragile mindset. So dismal had been her results since she plucked a look-what-I-found gold medal off the giant slalom heap in Sestriere, that it seemed her primary mission on Whistler Mountain was to stir up a little free publicity for a new line of sexy undergarments she'd designed herself. Looking ahead (or behind, given that thongs make up the brunt of Mancuso' "Kiss My Tierra" collection) she had surely begun to realize skiing couldn't support her much longer, not the way she was headed. But after two events -- the downhill and the super combined, in which Mancuso mastered the slopes like the Julia we remember -- she already had two shiny new silver medals to hang around her neck. Added to the gold from Italy, they left her tied with Bode Miller -- for a day at least, until Miller roared ahead by collecting two more -- as the most decorated U.S. Olympic skiers ever. "I'm not one to think much about statistics," Mancuso said, "but when somebody told me that, I couldn't believe it." Lindsey Vonn, Mancuso's friend going back to their pee-wee skiing days, was supposed to be the singular American centerpiece of these Olympics. Given her World Cup dominance of the past three seasons, the breathless consensus was that she could be Michael Phelps 2.0. Mancuso, although a defending champion, was barely an afterthought. At the team's pre-Olympics team press conference when Vonn revealed she had a severe shin bruise that might imperil her very participation, Mancuso would be asked only a couple of questions from the floor. And one of those sought her opinion of Vonn's posing for Sports Illustrated in a bikini. While supportive -- as would be expected -- on that count, saying, "I think it's important for us to celebrate our femininity," Mancuso later expressed a measure of resentment about how Vonn, who had yet win her first Olympic medal, had taken over the conversation. "I think some of the rest of us," Mancuso said, "deserve a little more attention." She was right. To date, their results have been similar. Vonn, gamely battling the pain in her leg, owns a gold and a bronze, beating Mancuso in the downhill but crashing out in the super combined, when Mancuso placed second. Mancuso was ninth in the super-G, when Vonn earned her bronze. Grading on the expectations curve, there's little doubt which woman has enjoyed herself more. At 21, Mancuso went to Turin much as she arrived in Whistler at 25, burdened by no inner or outer weight to succeed. "Four years ago, I thought I was really strong going into the Games," she recalls. "I'd had OK results -- not what I'd expected, but I was skiing with confidence. I went into the last race with an open mind, thinking anything was possible. Earning the gold taught me a lesson that I learn every day, that everything is possible. So I start every day with a smile." Speaking before her successes of last week, Mancuso said: "I feel very similar now. I'm really healthy. The season has been good, if not incredible. The skiing is there, my speed is there. I'm just coming in with an open mind, trying to feel the Olympic spirit and stay positive. Hopefully, I'll defend that gold medal and maybe pick up some other ones in other events. "But I'm really just here to go ski and have fun. I love skiing." Mancuso's opportunity to defend in the giant slalom comes Wednesday. With those silvers in the bank, Mancuso will be able to ski loose and easy, like the free spirit she is. Vonn and Mancuso couldn't be more different, the former going about her business with an almost grim, tunnel-visioned obsession while the latter is wont to happily shoosh down hillsides by the seat of her pants, no pun intended. Whatever happens now, the Whistler Olympiad will be remembered as a super one for "Super Jules." "It's been a long journey for me," Mancuso said. "But it goes to show you, you can do anything you put your mind to."Australia has threatened Japan with international legal action if it doesn't cease whaling. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said on Friday Australia was pursuing Japan through diplomatic channels, but had set a deadline for it to end whaling in the Southern Ocean. "If that fails, then we will initiate court action before the commencement of the whaling season in November 2010," he said. "But that's the bottom line and we're very clear to the Japanese, that's what we intend to do." Rudd said. The Australian Greens party says in a statement on Friday Japan should be taken to the International Court of Justice during the current whaling season, not next one. Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said in a statement on Friday he would discuss whaling and potential legal action with his Japanese counterpart Katsuya Okada when they meet in Perth on Sunday. However, he says the meeting will focus mainly on bilateral trade. Japan is Australia's second-largest trading partner and export market and the third-largest source of foreign investment, according to Smith.Following are the results in the 2 million U.S. dollar WTA Dubai Open here on Tuesday (prefix denotes seeding): Second round Shahar Peer, Israel, bt Virginie Razzano, France, 6-2, 6-2 1-Caroline Wozniacki, Denmark, bt Dominika Cibulkova, Slovakia, 6-2, 7-6 (7-2)Scotland winger Thom Evans will have a second operation this week on the neck injury that ended his season. The Scottish Rugby Union says the surgery will build on that carried out the day after Evans was carried from the field in Saturday's 31-24 Six Nations defeat at Wales. Scotland team doctor James Robson says "the surgeons are delighted with his progress" and that the procedure will "provide further stabilisation to his neck." The SRU said Tuesday that Evans should return home soon after the surgery. Chris Paterson is recovering from the kidney bruising he sustained in the same game. The fullback is in the same hospital in Cardiff, Wales, and visited Evans on Tuesday.The first big US-led offensive against the Taliban of the new surge strategy is "going well," the White House said Wednesday after President Barack Obama was briefed by his top war commander. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said that General Stanley McChrystal told Obama by video link during a meeting of the president's war cabinet that the "operation is going well." Gibbs said McChrystal also lauded the role in the fight of nascent Afghan security forces, and said the US-led effort was taking pains to avoid civilian casualties.Olympic Games women's biathlon 10km pursuit podium on Tuesday: Gold: Magdalena Neuner (GER) Silver: Anastazia Kuzmina (SVK) Bronze: Marie Laure Brunet (FRA)Duty Editor: Bryan McManus Telephone: +33 1 4041 7968 US-politics-economy-budget,lead WASHINGTON US President Barack Obama unveils a new spending plan aimed at reining in a massive budget deficit while still supporting the economic recovery and job creation. 650 words 1130 GMT Japan-US-auto-company-recall-Toyota,newseries-WRAP WASHINGTON Toyota readies an announcement on repairs for millions of vehicles affected by a safety recall due to faulty accelerator pedals, as its executives go into damage-control mode. 500 words 1200 GMT.

Lamy Chappuis, who was ranked fifth after the jumping session, started 46 seconds behind the leader but gradually cut down the gap and overtook American Johnny Spillane near the finish of the 10km cross country race. Italian Alessandro Pittin finished third. Janne Ryynaenen of Finland, winner of the jump, started the cross country with a 34-second advantage but fell early on and was quickly overtaken.An adviser to Kenya's prime minister says Cabinet ministers from the premier's party will boycott future Cabinet meetings until a dispute with the president is resolved. Salim Lone says the ministers made the decision Tuesday because they feel Prime Minister Raila Odinga cannot function effectively following a dispute with the president. Odinga on Sunday suspended two ministers following allegations of corruption. Hours later, President Mwai Kibaki annulled the suspensions. The spat has sparked a debate in Kenya about constitutional powers and high levels of corruption. Odinga has asked former U.N. chief Kofi Annan to mediate, and Kenya's Attorney General has warned that the dispute could foster a constitutional crisis.Canada's Sidney Crosby and Russia's Alex Ovechkin, the National Hockey League's two top stars, carry their heated personal rivalry into the Vancouver Olympics and a possible showdown for gold. As the best playmakers on favored teams with tremendous hockey history, the Olympic focus would be on "Alex the Great" and "Sid the Kid" anyway, but their own competitive fire and history ensure electricity if Russia and Canada meet. "Our games can speak for themselves," Crosby said. "He's a great player. It's always a tough battle." Ovechkin, 24, is a gap-toothed magician with a stick whose solo moves for the NHL's Washington Capitals are often spectacular. Passes to Olympic teammate Alexander Semin or Sweden's Nicklas Backstrom are often eye-popping as well. Crosby, 22, is having the greatest goal-scoring season of his NHL career after being known for his work as a set-up man. The Pittsburgh Penguins captain inherited the mantle of Canadian hockey's top star from legend Wayne Gretzky. There's no guarantee Russia and Canada will meet at Vancouver because they are in opposite round-robin groups. If they meet in the medal knockout rounds, it promises to be an epic to command the world's attention. Ovechkin was the NHL's top draft pick in 2004 when a labour dispute wiped out the entire season. Crosby was the top pick in 2005 and he helped the Penguins escape financial troubles and win the Stanley Cup in 2009. "I'm always jealous of people who win the Cup," Ovechkin said earlier this month. "But I hope this year it's going to be us." Ovechkin signed a 13-year contract extension worth 124 million dollars in early 2008. Crosby signed a five-year extension worth 43.5 million dollars in 2007, 8.7 million a year for a man born in 1987 who wears jersey number 87. Crosby won the 2007 NHL scoring crown and Most Valuable Player honors. "Ovie" won the 2008 and 2009 Most Valuable Player award and the 2008 scoring crown. The Canada-Russia rivalry pre-dates the latest superstars, its roots firmly in the 1972 Summit Series won by Canada over the Soviet Union but only on a last- minute goal in the final game. Ovechkin is not afraid to deliver a hit or to respond when he takes one. He suffered a broken nose early in a game against Montreal and answered with four goals, including an over-time game winner. Ovechkin is also flashy and flamboyant, slamming himself into the plexiglass to celebrate goals. "Some people like it. Some don't," Crosby said. "Personally, I don't." Ovechkin has criticized Crosby as talking too much while both have tried to stress team aspects of their rivalry. Ovechkin led the Russians to the 2003 world junior crown in Canada but two years later in the United States, Canada ripped Russia 6-1 in the final and sent Ovechkin out of the game with a shoulder injury. While Ovechkin led Russia to a world title in 2008 after the Capitals were ousted in round one of the NHL playoffs, Crosby guided Pittsburgh to the Stanley Cup finals. Last year, the Penguins eliminated Washington in the second round of the playoffs on their way to taking the Cup. When Pittsburgh visited Washington a week ago, Crosby scored twice to put the Penguins on top and match Ovechkin for the NHL goals lead at 39. Ovechkin answered with three goals and rallied the Capitals to victory.Western leaders have acted like Vladimir Putin in sending "premature" congratulations to Ukraine presidential election winner Viktor Yanukovych, allies of his rival, Yulia Tymoshenko, said Friday. Commenting on the messages of congratulations sent by US President Barack Obama and other Western leaders and institutions, Andri Shkil, a member of parliament in Tymoshenko's party, said: "I find this premature." "The West is behaving the same way Putin has in the past" by congratulating Yanukovych before full and officially certified results from last Sunday's presidential election have been published, Shkil said. He was referring to the congratulations that Putin, then Russia's president, sent to Yanukovych after a disputed 2004 election which were premature and helped trigger Ukraine's Orange Revolution and a re-run of that vote. Tymoshenko, Ukraine's fiery prime minister and Yanukovych's rival in Sunday's election, has so far refused to concede defeat, though official and full results show she lost by more than three percent. Both the electoral campaign and the vote itself won high praise from Western observers and governments as a model of democracy. Tymoshenko however says the vote was marred by irregularities and has vowed to contest it. "I can guarantee you that if we manage to invalidate the election results and Tymoshenko is declared the winner, she will receive the same congratulations from the same leaders," Shkil said. Tymoshenko shot to fame as a hero of the Orange Revolution and analysts have attributed her refusal to concede to a combination of personal weakness and political strength in Ukraine's rough-and-tumble political scene. Another deputy from Tymoshenko's party, Sergei Sobolev, defended her decision to fight on despite the world's unambiguous recognition of Yanukovych's victory and his call on her to resign. "We have a legal right to contest the results," Sobolev said. "This is a tradition that exists in the world and they have used their right to act in accordance with this tradition. So we are using our right to contest the result of the vote." Ukraine's election commission has published results from 100 percent of voting stations. Those results however must still be double-checked and certified as definitive, a step expected to occur later this month.Lee Sang-hwa of South Korea took a surprise lead after the first heat of the women's 500-meter speedskating race Tuesday at the Richmond Olympic Oval. German world-record holder Jenny Wolf and Wang Beixing of China were the clear leading contenders, having swept all eight races during the World Cup season. But Lee topped the field in 38.24 seconds, and Wolf is the only one within striking distance at 38.30. Wang is far back in third at 38.48.Visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that "crippling sanctions" must be imposed immediately against Iran's energy sector. "The time to apply sanctions is now, and they should be crippling sanctions," Netanyahu said in an interview with the Interfax news agency. The sanctions should stop Iran from importing gasoline and halt the Islamic republic's oil exports because the Iranian economy was dependent on both, Netanyahu said. The prime minister said he had discussed the issue with the presidents of Russia, the United States and France. The proposed sanctions could be "highly effective in the short and medium term," Netanyahu said. "Therefore, they should be imposed now before Iran is able to complete its nuclear program." Netanyahu is in Russia to push for additional sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program. He held talks with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on Monday and was scheduled to meet Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Tuesday.AC Milan midfielder David Beckham insists he will be able to cope with the emotions of his first encounter with former club Manchester United in the Champions League on Tuesday. Beckham will face United in a competitive game for the first time since quitting Old Trafford to join Real Madrid in 2003 when the English champions visit the San Siro for the first knockout round first leg. The 34-year-old, on loan at Milan from LA Galaxy, spent 10 years in Sir Alex Ferguson's team after emerging from United's youth academy and won a host of honours including the Champions League and Premier League. Beckham is a self-confessed United fan and the England midfielder admits it will be quite an occasion to come up against his old friends. But he is confident he will be able to keep his emotions in check and help Milan in one of the Champions League's biggest fixtures this season. "Obviously there will be emotions but I don't think it will be a problem. I've played in many big games," Beckham told the Sunday Times. "There has been so much talk about me going back to Manchester United in the second leg, because it will be my first time playing for a club there in seven years. "But this tie is not just about me playing against United, it's about AC Milan. It's about two great clubs coming together, and that's what makes it such a big game, for the teams, for the fans." Beckham believes in-form United striker Wayne Rooney, who has 23 goals this season, is the man his side must stop if they want to reach the quarter-finals. "I have always thought that Wayne is one of the best goalscorers in football anywhere. He's proving that," Beckham said. "He's at a great club and doing what he does best, which is scoring goals. United are playing so well for him, too."The Dalai Lama's chief envoy said Tuesday that President Barack Obama probably will not make a public appearance this week with the Tibetan spiritual leader during a White House visit that is already infuriating China. A joint appearance by Obama and the Dalai Lama before reporters could make tense U.S.-China ties even worse and further complicate U.S. efforts to secure Chinese help in settling North Korean and Iranian nuclear standoffs and crucial economic, military and environmental issues. Still, Lodi Gyari said Thursday's meeting in the White House between the Nobel Peace laureates would be an important boost for Tibet and for the broader U.S. commitment to human rights. The Dalai Lama, who has met with every U.S. president for the last two decades, is a recurring needle in U.S.-Chinese ties. China accuses him of pushing for Tibetan independence -- something he has repeatedly denied -- and considers meetings between the monk and foreign leaders to be an infringement on Chinese sovereignty. This week's meeting follows a tense couple of months in what the Obama administration has called the world's most important relationship, highlighted by the recent U.S. announcement of a $6.4 billion arms sale to Taiwan, the self-governing democratic island Beijing claims as its own. Former President George W. Bush appeared at the public presentation in 2007 of a Congressional Gold Medal Award to the Dalai Lama, but presidential meetings with the Dalai Lama have typically been held away from reporters, often in the White House's private residences. Gyari, in a briefing ahead of the Dalai Lama's Wednesday arrival in Washington, said that while the Dalai Lama doesn't care where he meets the president, the symbolism of the location is very important to other Tibetans and to human rights activists in the United States and elsewhere. Gyari said he has always been puzzled by U.S. presidents not meeting with the Dalai Lama in the Oval Office. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters Tuesday that he did not know if Obama and the Dalai Lama would make a televised appearance after their meeting. Obama received heavy criticism when he did not meet with the Dalai Lama when the monk came to Washington in October. Gyari called that decision a "setback," and said it hurt Tibetans who expect the Dalai Lama to meet with the president when he visits Washington. Gyari said that smaller countries could also point to the decision as a precedent for bowing to pressure by China to scrap meetings with the Dalai Lama. The White House said there was no meeting with the Dalai Lama in October so that Obama could better raise Tibet issues in a November summit with Chinese President Hu Jintao. Gyari said his high-level talks with Chinese officials last month on Tibetan efforts to gain greater autonomy produced no results. He warned that the Dalai Lama is China's best chance for gaining legitimacy for its rule in Tibet and said Beijing must stop insulting the Dalai Lama and treating Tibetans as second class citizens. He said China's angry reaction to Thursday's meeting is a sign of worrisome arrogance and chauvinism in Beijing. China maintains that Tibet has been part of its territory for centuries, but many Tibetans say the region was functionally independent for much of its history.Jason Lamy Chappuis of France overtook American Johnny Spillane on the final straight for the gold medal in the Nordic combined individual race. Chappauis won in 25 minutes, 47.1 seconds on Sunday, four-tenths of a second ahead of Spillane, who gave the United States its first ever Olympic medal in the sport. Italy's Alessandro Pittin took the bronze, finishing eight-tenths of a second behind Chappuis and just ahead of American Todd Lodwick. Spillane and Lodwick took turns leading the way for much of the race and Spillane looked to have an insurmountable lead as he made his final turn. But Chappuis finished faster to win the event that featured one jump on the normal hill and a 10-kilometer cross-country race. Lodwick started in second place behind Finland's Janne Ryynaenen, who had the longest jump of the day. Spillane started in fourth, 44 seconds behind Ryynaenen and Chappuis in fifth, 46 seconds behind the leader.US vice presidents past and present traded blows Sunday with Joe Biden accusing predecessor Dick Cheney of trying to "rewrite history" by painting the current administration as soft on terror. Cheney countered that Biden was "dead wrong" when he said another terrorist attack on the scale of September 11, 2001 was unlikely and made out that President Barack Obama's administration were dangerously naive. The clashes, in interviews to three different US television networks, were billed as a battle royal between long-time rivals on foreign and security policy: Biden the liberal-leaning Democrat and Cheney the hawkish Republican. Cheney said the administration should have been prepared to use harsh interrogation techniques such as waterboarding on Nigerian jet bomb suspect Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. Obama prohibited such techniques, routinely used by Cheney and former president George W. Bush's administration to extract information from Al-Qaeda suspects, saying the United States would be stronger by upholding its ideals. US officials say 23-year-old Abdulmutallab is cooperating and has confessed to being trained by Al-Qaeda members in Yemen to blow up a passenger jet from Amsterdam as it came in to land in Detroit on Christmas Day. Biden hit back hard at charges that Abdulmutallab should have been handed over to the military for interrogation, saying the Bush administration had treated shoe bomber Richard Reid exactly the same way back in 2001. "Dick Cheney's a fine fellow. He's entitled to his own opinion. He's not entitled to rewrite history. He's not entitled to his own facts," Biden told NBC. "He either is misinformed or he is misinforming. But the facts are that his assertions are not accurate." Cheney warned, though, that this was just one example of how the Obama administration was framing "terror attacks against the United States as criminal acts, as opposed to acts of war." He recalled battles he had waged while vice president, describing a "major shootout" to convince the US Justice Department about the need to treat terrorist attacks as acts of war and put suspects before military commissions. "I think we have to treat it as a war. This is a strategic threat to the United States. I think that's why we were successful for seven-and-a-half years in avoiding a further major attack against the United States." Cheney defended the notorious US detention center at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, which Obama has vowed to shut down, and attacked the president's decision to try accused September 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in New York. It's "a big, big mistake," he said. "It gives him a huge platform to promulgate his particular brand of propaganda around the world. "I think he ought to be at Guantanamo. I think he ought to be tried at Guantanamo in front of a military commission." Biden, in his two interviews, repeatedly disputed Cheney's assertions and said the Obama administration was pursuing the war against Al-Qaeda "with a vigor like it's never been seen before. "Under the Bush administration, there were three trials in military courts," he said. "Two of those people are now walking the streets. They are free." "We've eliminated 12 of their top 20 people," he said. "We have taken out 100 of their associates... We've sent them underground. They are in fact not able to do anything remotely like they were in the past. They are on the run. "I don't know where Dick Cheney has been," Biden continued. "Look, it's one thing, again, to criticize. It's another thing to sort of rewrite history. What is he talking about?" In a rare moment of concord with the Obama administration, Cheney backed the president to the hilt on Afghanistan, where US, British and Afghan forces have launched a major offensive against the Taliban. But as one of the principal architects of the war in Iraq and a darling of hardline conservatives, Cheney chuckled about a recent quote from Biden claiming it was one of the Obama administration's greatest successes. "I guess I shouldn't be surprised by my friend, Joe Biden. I'm glad he now believes Iraq is a success. Joe Biden wants to take credit -- I'm not sure for what -- since he opposed that policy pretty much from the outset." Obama opposed the war in Iraq and campaigned on shifting the focus of the US military back to Afghanistan.Equities at Pakistan's Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) gained almost 100 points to close way above 9, 800 levels on Wednesday, as investors said welcome to the latest developments on the political front. Pakistani Prime Minister Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani surprised everyone on Tuesday night when he suddenly arrived at a reception by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry in honor of Justice (Retd) Khalil-ur-Rehman Ramday, after which the Prime Minister told reporters that he has invited the Chief Justice to PM House for a one-on-one meeting. Investors remained buoyed after the latest development as the benchmark KSE 100-Index jumped by 1.00 percent or 97.41 points to close at 9,867.09 levels, KSE 30-Index climbed by 1.27 percent or 128.22 points to conclude at 10,246.08 levels, whereas KSE All Share Index surged by 0.94 percent or 64.96 points to finish at 6, 997.49 levels. In another development, leader of Pakistan's main opposition party, i.e. Pakistan Muslim League-N, Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif started his political campaign in Sindh city of Ghotki. Analysts are of the view that this might trigger another political pressure on the already struggling coalition government as the main opposition party has for the first time come up with something substantial against the incumbent government. Investors mostly remained active in telecom, oil and gas exploration, cement, and power generation sectors. Oil and gas exploration sector remained in the limelight after as many as ten companies signed Licences/Petroleum Concession Agreements with eight E&P companies on Tuesday. The total area of the ten blocks would be 17,789.77 square kilometers with a minimum firm work commitment of 52.6 million U.S. dollars. Investors' keen interest also helped the market in registering far better volume numbers as a turnover of 201.222 million shares was recorded as compared to 120.588 million shares, showing an increment by 66.87 percent or 80.63 million shares. The market started off the day in a positive mood and bulls strengthened their position at the Exchange with every passing minute where just around the halfway stage, the main index stormed past 9,900 levels and at one stage it went on to hit an intraday high of 9,929.93 levels. However, some profit-taking at higher levels ate up some of the earlier gains and index had to contend with 97-point surge and settled below 9,900 levels. Analysts informed Xinhua that the main reasons behind the bullish charge at the Exchange was the PM-CJP meeting and 10 oil exploration companies signing licenses to explore oil fields in Pakistan. In broader market, a total of 418 scrips traded hands during the course of the day, out of which gainers outpaced losers with a ratio of 235 to 158 while prices of 25 other issues remained unchanged. Analysts said that if the Prime Minister and the Chief Justice get success in solving the latest crisis, then market is in a position to go past 10,000-mark in the next week. They further stated that day traders could sell at 9,840 levels and they might stop buying over 9,850 levels, so there are chances that bears might stage a comeback at the Exchange on Thursday. However, if things turned green on the political front then investors would continue to go on with the buying spree. The top traded scrip of the day was WorldCall Telecom with trading of 29.292 million shares, followed by Lotte Pakistan PTA, Oil and Gas Development Company Limited, DG Khan Cement, and TRG Pakistan Limited with turnovers of 13.993 million, 8.721 million, 7.227 million, and 6.658 million shares respectively.US vice presidents past and present traded blows Sunday with Joe Biden accusing predecessor Dick Cheney of trying to "rewrite history" by painting the current administration as soft on terror. Cheney countered that Biden was "dead wrong" when he said another terrorist attack on the scale of September 11, 2001 was unlikely and made out that President Barack Obama's administration were dangerously naive. The clashes, in interviews to three different US television networks, were billed as a battle royal between long-time rivals on foreign and security policy: Biden the liberal-leaning Democrat and Cheney the hawkish Republican. Cheney said the administration should have been prepared to use harsh interrogation techniques such as waterboarding on Nigerian jet bomb suspect Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. Obama prohibited such techniques, routinely used by Cheney and former president George W. Bush's administration to extract information from Al-Qaeda suspects, saying the United States would be stronger by upholding its ideals. US officials say 23-year-old Abdulmutallab is cooperating and has confessed to being trained by Al-Qaeda members in Yemen to blow up a passenger jet from Amsterdam as it came in to land in Detroit on Christmas Day. Biden hit back hard at charges that Abdulmutallab should have been handed over to the military for interrogation, saying the Bush administration had treated shoe bomber Richard Reid exactly the same way back in 2001. "Dick Cheney's a fine fellow. He's entitled to his own opinion. He's not entitled to rewrite history. He's not entitled to his own facts," Biden told NBC. "He either is misinformed or he is misinforming. But the facts are that his assertions are not accurate." Cheney warned, though, that this was just one example of how the Obama administration was framing "terror attacks against the United States as criminal acts, as opposed to acts of war." He recalled battles he had waged while vice president, describing a "major shootout" to convince the US Justice Department about the need to treat terrorist attacks as acts of war and put suspects before military commissions. "I think we have to treat it as a war. This is a strategic threat to the United States. I think that's why we were successful for seven-and-a-half years in avoiding a further major attack against the United States." Cheney defended the notorious US detention center at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, which Obama has vowed to shut down, and attacked the president's decision to try accused September 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in New York. It's "a big, big mistake," he said. "It gives him a huge platform to promulgate his particular brand of propaganda around the world. "I think he ought to be at Guantanamo. I think he ought to be tried at Guantanamo in front of a military commission." Biden, in his two interviews, repeatedly disputed Cheney's assertions and said the Obama administration was pursuing the war against Al-Qaeda "with a vigor like it's never been seen before. "Under the Bush administration, there were three trials in military courts," he said. "Two of those people are now walking the streets. They are free." "We've eliminated 12 of their top 20 people," he said. "We have taken out 100 of their associates... We've sent them underground. They are in fact not able to do anything remotely like they were in the past. They are on the run. "I don't know where Dick Cheney has been," Biden continued. "Look, it's one thing, again, to criticize. It's another thing to sort of rewrite history. What is he talking about?" In a rare moment of concord with the Obama administration, Cheney backed the president to the hilt on Afghanistan, where US, British and Afghan forces have launched a major offensive against the Taliban. But as one of the principal architects of the war in Iraq and a darling of hardline conservatives, Cheney chuckled about a recent quote from Biden claiming it was one of the Obama administration's greatest successes. "I guess I shouldn't be surprised by my friend, Joe Biden. I'm glad he now believes Iraq is a success. Joe Biden wants to take credit -- I'm not sure for what -- since he opposed that policy pretty much from the outset." Obama opposed the war in Iraq and campaigned on shifting the focus of the US military back to Afghanistan.Lucie Safarova of Czech Republic rallied to beat second-seeded Flavia Pennetta of Italy 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 on Saturday and reach the final of the Open GDF Suez. Safarova, who played in the final three years ago, will face the winner of the other semifinal between top seed Elena Dementieva of Russia and Melanie Oudin of the United States. Safarova lost her first set of the tournament but went on to post her second win in as many matches against Pennetta. Pennetta saved two break points early in the first set and took her opponent's serve for a 4-3 lead, and then held with an ace. Safarova saved one set point in the next game before Pennetta took the set in 37 minutes with her fifth ace of the match. Both players traded serves twice early in the second set but Safarova went up 4-2 with another break and extended her lead to 5-2 before winning the set. Safarova converted her only break point of the decider in the ninth game and closed out the match by holding her serve.Top-seeded Juan Carlos Ferrero has booked his place in the final of the Brazil Open, where he will face unseeded Lukasz Kubot. Spain's Ferrero defeated Ricardo Mello of Brazil, 6-4, 6-2 on Saturday, after Poland's Kubot defeated fourth-seeded Igor Andreev of Russia 2-6, 6-2, 6-4. Kubot served nine aces in beating the Russian on Saturday in just under two hours on the outdoor clay court.Scotland team doctor James Robson says injured trio Thom Evans, Chris Paterson and Rory Lamont will miss the rest of the Six Nations. Evans underwent successful neck surgery following a collision with Wales fullback Lee Byrne in Saturday's Six Nations match at Millennium Stadium. Robson said Sunday that Evans will need "a long period of rest and recuperation, but that it's the end of his season." Paterson bruised a kidney and was held overnight at the same Cardiff hospital as Evans. Lamont has injured his knee. Wales won the match 31-24.Dustin Johnson birdied the final hole Sunday to earn a one-stroke victory in the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, becoming the first player to win title two years in a row. Unlike last year, when his 54-hole lead gave him the victory when rain washed out the final round, Johnson had to work to the bitter end. He closed with a two-over 74 for a 16-under par total of 270. Former world number one David Duval shot a 69 and JB Holmes a 71 to share second on 271. Paul Goydos, who started the day sharing the lead with Johnson, had a one-stroke lead until he plummeted down the leaderboard with a quadruple-bogey nine at the 14th. He carded a 78 and finished tied for fifth four shots adrift.A young United States squad of National Hockey League standouts assembled Sunday at the Winter Olympics with a desire to build chemistry quickly between former foes and prove they are a contender. "Our intention is to win a gold medal. We're confident we can do that," said US coach Ron Wilson. "On paper, we're probably not going to be the favourite but we believe in ourselves and we're going to put our best foot forward." The team's average age, 26.5, is five years younger than the 2006 team that placed eighth in Turin and won only once. Players Wilson guided to a World Cup title in 1996 were stalwarts for a decade, but a new generation has arrived. "There was a lot of soul searching. The greatest generation of US players did such a marvellous job," US general manager Brian Burke said. "It was agonizing to turn that page but we came with a team that's very talented." Some players have worked together on successful US junior teams, but captain Jamie Langenbrunner knows much remains before the US squad opens the 12-team competition at mid-day Tuesday against Switzerland. "We're definitely getting thrown in there," Langenbrunner said. "We'll start getting to know each other and start building that chemistry we will need." Wilson, who has alerted players as to whom their linemates are, said he has a balanced lineup of players who know their roles. "Balance is our strength. I don't have to worry about guys harping about ice time," Wilson said. "The challenge is building chemistry in a hurry. It is a big chemistry test. In a short tournament you try and simplify everything." Russia, sparked by NHL scoring leader Alex Ovechkin, and Canada, led by Sidney Crosby, are considered favourites with defending champion Sweden given a solid chance to repeat. "We're underdogs. That's fine with us," Burke said. "Nobody is talking about us and that's fine with us. We're excited to be here and we're determined to make some noise. "Sometimes when you're young you don't know any better than to go all out." Games will be played on an NHL-sized rink rather than the wider surface used in past Olympics. That should make for hard hitting but less adapting for NHL players on the elite rosters. "It's an NHL-style tournament. An NHL rink will make the transition (easier) for all our players," Wilson said. "It's quite an adjustment without any practice to go from an NHL rink to an Olympic-sized rink." Wilson guided a favored US team at the 1998 Nagano Games, the first to use NHL players. The Americans were ousted in the quarter-finals and some players trashed a room in the Olympic village in their anger. "Everybody expected us to in gold. We found out rather quickly it's hard to catch lightning in a bottle once, let alone twice," Wilson said. "Hopefully we will be a little more prepared, a little more experienced at what to expect."Mikhail Youzhny upset top seed Novak Djokovic 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (8/6) Saturday to reach his second final at the Rotterdam Open. The 2007 winner from Russian will battle Swede Robin Soderling in the Sunday title match. Soderling, seeded third, reached his second career final here, dominating second seed Nikolay Davydenko 7-6 (7/3), 6-4. The Swede is aiming to go one better after losing the 2008 final here to Michael Llodra. Soderling stands 2-1 over Youzhny, winning their last pair of encounters over the past two seasons. Youzhny took advantage of Djokovic, who had a walkover in his quarter-final and had not played since Thursday. But the Serb did not roll over, saving two match points in the ninth game of the second set and another in the tiebreaker before the Russian prevailed in two and a quarter hours. "I was a bit lucky in the tiebreaks," said the winner. "I was quite tired after my quarter-final. I had to play patiently against him. "Every time the game speeded up he would win the points." Youzhny said he faces a major recovery to be ready for Soderling. "It will be very tough for me, there is no time for recovery. Robin's in good shape and is playing well. We'll just have to see." Soderling pounded over five aces against Davydenko, setting up his match point with his last one after one hour, 43 minutes. The frustrated Davydenko was unable to stop the Swedish momentum as Soderling chipped a winning volley into the empty court to seal victory. Davydenko, one of the form players of the past six months on the ATP, had complained all week about a court which he said was too fast for his game. "The court is the court, it's what it is," said Soderling, the world number eight Roland Garros finalist from last year who now stands 7-4 over the Russian. "I'm happy to have beaten one of the best players in the world," he said after victory over Davydenko, winner of the season-ending event last November in London and the Doha champion last month. "It could have easily been the other way around. Our matches have always been very close, we seem to alternate with the wins. "At Grand Slam they always go five sets." The opening set tiebreaker was the fifth between the pair and resulted in the first victory in a decider for Soderling against Davydenko. The Swede lost an early break in the first set, dropping serve while aiming for the opening set leading 5-3. The set eventually went into the tiebereaker, where Soderling prevailed. The Swede sealed the second set as he took a 5-4 lead on a break a game before serving out victory. Davydenko, who will take next week off to have treatment on his foot before travelling to Dubai, stood 31-6 since last year's US Open, earning a dozen of his victories in 2010.Going back and forth across the airwaves, Vice President Joe Biden and predecessor Dick Cheney bickered Sunday over terror trials and interrogations, credit for success in Iraq and the long-running effort to contain Iran's nuclear program. Biden called Cheney "misinformed or he is misinforming" on current national security strategies. Cheney said President Barack Obama wasn't taking the al-Qaida threat seriously. But, in a marked change of tone, the former vice president acknowledged that the Bush White House struggled with how to bring suspected terrorists to justice. Highly partisan public skirmishes between the Obama White House and Cheney -- the result of the former vice president's unusual public criticism of a successor administration -- have become standard fare. And the back-and-forth that was set up in Sunday's sequential appearances of television talk shows did not disappoint. Biden struck first, declaring that Cheney's attacks on Obama's commitment to fighting terrorism ignored the facts. "We've eliminated 12 of their top 20 people. We have taken out 100 of their associates," said Biden. "They are in fact not able to do anything remotely like they were in the past. They are on the run. I don't know where Dick Cheney has been. Look, it's one thing, again, to criticize. It's another thing to sort of rewrite history. What is he talking about?" Cheney did not answer directly, instead insisting that Biden was "dead wrong" to assert that a fresh Sept. 11-style strike was unlikely, calling a nuclear or biological attack by al-Qaida "the biggest strategic threat the United States faces today." Even so, Cheney appeared to dial back the rhetoric, acknowledging that the Bush administration too was divided on whether terror suspects should be charged and tried in federal civilian courts or taken before military tribunals. "I can remember," Cheney said, "a meeting in the Roosevelt Room in the West Wing of the White House where we had a major shootout" -- one that he said he lost -- about civilian versus military trials for terrorist captives. "We never clearly or totally resolved those issues. These are tough questions, no doubt about it," he said on ABC television's "This Week." Biden got in the first licks on NBC's "Meet the Press" in an interview taped late Saturday in Canada, where he was attending the Vancouver Olympic Games. On Cheney's assault on the Obama administration, Biden said "his assertions are not accurate." Cheney demurred on that allegation, choosing instead to take on again Obama's decision to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In doing so, he admitted for a second time that he had been at odds with the majority of Bush administration officials on the decision to release prisoners from the military lockup to their home countries when cases against them were determined to be legally untenable. "I didn't think that releasing anybody was the right thing to do, unless you had evidence that, you know, there was a mistake of some kind," Cheney said. On Afghanistan and Obama's decision to increase U.S. forces in the 8-year-old war, Cheney gave Obama high marks. But he derided Biden for giving the Obama administration credit for winding down the war in Iraq without acknowledging the work of President George W. Bush. However, Biden had said: "We built on the positive things that the Bush administration had initiated. And we have jettisoned those things that were negative." "For them to try to take credit for what happened in Iraq is a little strange. It ought to go with a healthy dose of 'thank you, George Bush,'" Cheney said. On other disputed topics: --Biden acknowledged that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the professed Sept. 11 attack planner, still might face trial in a military tribunal, despite the administration's earlier decision to take him before a civilian federal court in New York. That now seems unlikely given strong opposition from city authorities and members of Congress. Cheney said he believed Mohammed should and eventually would be tried by the military at a military facility. --Cheney advised the Obama administration against ruling out a military attack on Iran even as it works for a new set of United Nations sanctions. "I don't think you want to eliminate the military -- the possibility of military action. I think that's essential to give any kind of meaning at all to negotiations over sanctions," he said. The back and forth began with Biden on NBC, moved to ABC's "This Week" with Cheney and ended with Biden appearing live on CBS's "Face the Nation. There Biden got in the last word over Cheney: "Thank God the last administration didn't listen to him in the end" on how to handle terrorism suspects. Declaring that Obama was acting on the precedents set in the Bush White House, Biden said of Cheney, "His fight seems to be with the last administration."Jason Lamy Chappuis of France overtook American Johnny Spillane on the final straight for the gold medal in the Nordic combined individual race. Chappauis won in 25 minutes, 47.1 seconds on Sunday, four-tenths of a second ahead of Spillane, who gave the United States its first ever Olympic medal in the sport. Italy's Alessandro Pittin took the bronze, finishing eight-tenths of a second behind Chappuis and just ahead of American Todd Lodwick. Spillane and Lodwick took turns leading the way for much of the race and Spillane looked to have an insurmountable lead as he made his final turn. But Chappuis finished faster to win the event that featured one jump on the normal hill and a 10-kilometer cross-country race. Lodwick started in second place behind Finland's Janne Ryynaenen, who had the longest jump of the day. Spillane started in fourth, 44 seconds behind Ryynaenen and Chappuis in fifth, 46 seconds behind the leader.Vice President Joe Biden on Sunday belittled Dick Cheney's criticism of the Obama administration's commitment to fighting terrorism, saying his predecessor was either "misinformed or he is misinforming." Cheney doesn't listen to what's going on around him and is trying to rewrite history, Biden told NBC television's "Meet the Press." The former vice president has been a leading Republican critic of the Obama administration's handling of national security, contending that President Barack Obama is "trying to pretend" that the U.S. is not at war with terrorists. The result, Cheney says, is that Americans are less safe. Biden said that under Obama's direction, the U.S. has been more successful at killing al-Qaida leaders and their followers than it was during the years George W. Bush and Cheney were in the White House. "We've eliminated 12 of their top 20 people. We have taken out 100 of their associates," said Biden. "They are in fact not able to do anything remotely like they were in the past. They are on the run. I don't know where Dick Cheney has been. Look, it's one thing, again, to criticize. It's another thing to sort of rewrite history. What is he talking about?" Cheney, Biden said, "either is misinformed or he is misinforming. But the facts are that his assertions are not accurate." The extraordinary and public back-and-forth between the No. 2 officials in the current and former administration was expected to flare up with Cheney's appearance later Sunday on ABC's "This Week," followed by a second chance for Biden to respond, while on CBS' "Face the Nation." His NBC appearance was taped Saturday night from the Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia. Biden also said the Iraq war hasn't been worth its "horrible price" and that the Bush administration mishandled it from the outset by taking its "eye off the ball." That, he said, left the U.S. in a more dangerous position in Afghanistan, the al-Qaida stronghold where Osama bin Laden and his cohorts plotted the Sept 11 terror attacks. The war has also cost the United States support from other nations around the world, he said. Still, Biden said Iraq will have successful parliamentary elections next month and the U.S. is likely to bring home some 90,000 combat troops by summer's end. More than 4,370 U.S. military personnel have died in Iraq since Bush ordered the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 to overthrow Saddam Hussein. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have been wounded or killed. Turning to the main issue on the minds of most voters, Biden said Obama inherited a shrinking economy with financial institutions that were on the edge of collapse, threatening to move the world into a depression. Biden said the economy expanded at 5.8 percent during the last quarter and the U.S. has "stopped the hemorrhaging of jobs." He said there was "tangible evidence" the economy was moving in the right direction. By the time of November's elections, he said, "in addition to bringing home 90,000 American troops, troops out of Iraq, the story of this administration is going to be more clearly told, and we're going to be just fine."Hannah Kearney won the first U.S. gold medal of the Vancouver Olympics, taking the women's moguls by topping Canadian Jenn Heil. Kearney scored 26.63 points in the final Saturday night to defeat Heil by the wide margin of .94 points. American Shannon Bahrke took bronze to add to her silver medal from 2002. Kearney's win came after a 22nd place finish at the Turin Olympics -- a bitter disappointment after she came in as a favorite. It denied Heil, the defending Olympic champion, the chance to become the first Canadian to win Olympic gold on home turf.Ukraine's Central Election Commission (CEC) declared Viktor Yanukovych winner of the presidential election on Sunday. "The Central Election Commission declares opposition leader Viktor Yanukovych elected president of Ukraine," said CEC president Volodymyr Shapoval, quoted by the Interfax-Ukraine news agency. A final count of the votes showed Yanukovych defeating Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko by 3.5 percent points after last Sunday's poll. Tymoshenko said in a televised address to the public on Saturday that the vote was rigged and vowed to challenge the results in court.Scotland wing Thom Evans is to undergo a second operation following a neck injury sustained during last weekend's 31-24 Six Nations loss away to Wales, team doctor James Robson said on Tuesday. Evans was carried off on a stretcher at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday after a sickening collision with Wales full-back Lee Byrne and needed neck surgery at Cardiff University Hospital. Both Evans and Chris Paterson remain in the same hospital after the full-back's record-breaking 100th cap appearance for Scotland was cut short by a kidney injury. Robson, in a statement issued by the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU), said Tuesday: "Thom and his mum met with the surgeons last night (Monday) and Thom has opted to undergo a further procedure later this week, which will enhance the surgery that has already taken place and provide further stabilisation to his neck. "This procedure is optional and Thom could have decided to have it done at a later point, or not at all. He's decided to go ahead now and that should help with the whole recovery process. "Once he has settled from this procedure the expectation would be that he will be allowed to return home." He added: "Thom has been heartened by the many messages of support he has received from around the world. The surgeons are delighted with his progress." Turning to Paterson, Robson, who will travel to Cardiff on Wednesday, said: "Chris Paterson is continuing to make a good recovery from the injury he sustained to his kidney. "He is hopeful of being released from hospital either later today (Tuesday) or tomorrow (Wednesday). Then he would remain in Cardiff for a few days' rest before travelling home with his wife." Robson confirmed on Sunday that Evans, Paterson, Scotland's record points scorer, and back Rory Lamont would all miss the remainder of the Six Nations as a result of injuries they sustained in Cardiff. Lamont has been seen by an orthopaedic surgeon following the knee injury he suffered at the Millennium Stadium and has since undergone a scan at Edinburgh's SPIRE Murrayfield Hospital. He will be re-assessed in light of the results later this week. Scotland, fifth in the table after two defeats, continue their Six Nations campaign away to basement side Italy in Rome on February 27.Jason Lamy Chappuis of France overtook American Johnny Spillane on the final straight for the gold medal in the Nordic combined individual race. Chappauis won in 25 minutes, 47.1 seconds on Sunday, four-tenths of a second ahead of Spillane, who gave the United States its first ever Olympic medal in the sport. Italy's Alessandro Pittin took the bronze.Following are the results of Spanish first division soccer league on Saturday: Sporting Gijon 1 (Castro 6) Valencia 1 (Mata 76) Xerez 0 Real Madrid 3 (Arbeloa 64, Cristiano Ronaldo 69, 71) Villarreal 2 (Capdevila 5, Nilmar 45) Athletic Bilbao 1 (Gabilondo 24) Playing Sunday Racing Santander v Malaga Valladolid v Real Zaragoza Getafe v Almeria Espanyol v Deportivo La Coruna Sevilla v Osasuna Atletico Madrid v Barcelona Playing Monday Tenerife v Real MallorcaRobin Soderling won the ABN Amro final on Sunday when 2007 champion Mikhail Youzhny of Russia retired because of a thigh injury while trailing 6-4, 2-0. The third-seeded Soderling became the first Swedish winner of the indoor tournament since Anders Jarryd in 1993. Soderling, who lost the 2008 final to Michael Llodra, dropped serve in the first game of the match but broke back immediately. The Swede broke twice more in the first set and once in the second before Youzhny had to stop, giving Soderling his fifth career title. In the semifinals, Soderling beat second-seeded Nikolay Davydenko and Youzhny topped top-seeded Novak Djokovic.Dustin Johnson birdied the final hole Sunday to earn a one-stroke victory in the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, becoming the first player to win title two years in a row. Unlike last year, when his 54-hole lead gave him the victory when rain washed out the final round, Johnson had to work to the bitter end. He closed with a two-over 74 for a 16-under par total of 270. Former world number one David Duval shot a 69 and JB Holmes a 71 to share second on 271. Paul Goydos, who started the day sharing the lead with Johnson, had a one-stroke lead until he plummeted down the leaderboard with a quadruple-bogey nine at the 14th. He carded a 78 and finished tied for fifth four shots adrift.With Jeff Vinik to be the Lightning's fifth owner, the process of impressing the boss can begin. With no one will that be as intense and as important as with GM Brian Lawton, who not only heads hockey operations but has a contract that expires at the end of the season and is connected at the hip to outgoing co-owner Oren Koules as they run the organization day-to-day. Lawton does not hide from the reality. "When I signed up for this job, some of these things are part of the criteria," he said Saturday. "If it's too hot in the kitchen at any time, then I shouldn't have signed up. I signed up with free will. I'm thrilled I did, and I would do it again in a heartbeat." Vinik is not going to make any immediate changes. First, he isn't the owner until he gets approval from the NHL's Board of Governors and the financial deal closes; that's a two- to four-week process. And Vinik still has to hire a CEO type to start a top-down evaluation that will include players and coaches. But Lawton said he already had four or five conversations with Vinik at which he outlined his vision and methods. "I'm not going to start showing up to work any earlier. I don't think that's possible," Lawton said. "It's not like I'm going to stay any later. I don't think that's possible. A big part of the process is just explaining how I think and why. Here's how I operate and why." To be fair, Lawton has had a free hand only since June 23, when commissioner Gary Bettman put Koules and co-owner Len Barrie in a box, so to speak, and mandated Lawton be the point man in hockey operations. He also leads a team neck-deep in the playoff chase. "We've done exactly what we said we'd do," Lawton said. "That's the way you build long-term credibility. It's the actions that follow what you say." "It has to do with an overall body of work," he added. "The reason people sign for four or five years in this business is it just takes time to see what somebody is trying to do." Lawton doesn't have that luxury. Money matters: So, let's connect a few dots. Remember last summer when Barrie was to come up with $10 million to cover his part of this season's projected losses? Instead, the league said it was "satisfied" with a $10 million line of credit from an unnamed bank. The NHL, despite requests, never acknowledged if Barrie provided the money. You have to think if he did, the team's financial problems would not be so acute. Chances are, things would have gotten to this point anyway, but perhaps not as quickly.A White House spokesman says President Barack Obama is keeping a close watch on combat operations in Afghanistan, getting multiple updates as thousands of U.S. Marines and Afghan soldiers storm a Taliban stronghold. The attempt to take the Taliban stronghold of Marjah is the largest operation since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan. Spokesman Tommy Vietor said Obama is keeping abreast of the combat through the White House Situation Room. He said the president will also get an update from his national security advisor, Gen. Jim Jones, later in the day. Vietor said Defense Secretary Robert Gates will also have the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, brief Obama Sunday morning.Lucie Safarova of Czech Republic rallied to beat second-seeded Flavia Pennetta of Italy 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 on Saturday and reach the final of the Open GDF Suez. Safarova, who played in the final three years ago, will face the winner of the other semifinal between top seed Elena Dementieva of Russia and Melanie Oudin of the United States. Safarova lost her first set of the tournament but went on to post her second win in as many matches against Pennetta. Pennetta saved two break points early in the first set and took her opponent's serve for a 4-3 lead, and then held with an ace. Safarova saved one set point in the next game before Pennetta took the set in 37 minutes with her fifth ace of the match. Both players traded serves twice early in the second set but Safarova went up 4-2 with another break and extended her lead to 5-2 before winning the set. Safarova converted her only break point of the decider in the ninth game and closed out the match by holding her serve.Chelsea says that former Yugoslavia goalkeeper Petar Borota has died at the age of 56. Borota played 114 times for Chelsea after joining the English club from Partizan Belgrade in 1979. He won Chelsea's player of the year vote in 1981. Chelsea announced Borata's passing on Saturday, but gave no date or cause of the death. Former Chelea teammate Gary Chivers says that Borata "was the benchmark for the keepers of today because he was one of the first to dribble the ball out."Following are the results of ATP SAP Open tennis tournament at San Jose, on Friday (prefix number denotes seeding): Quarter-finals: Denis Istomin, Uzbekistan, bt 6-Philipp Kohlschreiber, Germany, 6-1, 1-6, 6-3 2-Fernando Verdasco, Spain, bt Ricardas Berankis, Lithuania, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5)What's coming up around the world: + US, Afghan troops launch major assault on Taliban + Tragedy overshadows opening of Winter Olympics + Campaigning begins for Sudan's presidential election KABUL: Coalition troops launch military operation in southern Afghanistan aimed at eradicating Taliban militants from one of their last bastions of control.

Carlo Ancelotti's side defeated Championship club Cardiff 4-1 at Stamford Bridge on Saturday and will have to wait until next week's replay at the Britannia Stadium to discover if City or Stoke will travel to west London. If Roberto Mancini's side get through it would mean a potentially uncomfortable meeting between Chelsea captain John Terry and City left-back Wayne Bridge. Terry is alleged to have had an affair with the ex-girlfriend of former Chelsea team-mate Bridge and fall-out from the scandal has already cost the Chelsea star the England captaincy. Crystal Palace, who were just minutes away from defeating Aston Villa before being held to a 2-2 draw at Selhurst Park, would face a fellow Championship side in Reading or West Brom if they can win their replay at Villa Park. Bolton or Tottenham, who shared a 1-1 draw at the Reebok Stadium on Sunday, will travel to Fulham, while troubled Portsmouth host Birmingham. Draw for the English FA Cup quarter-finals made on Sunday: Chelsea v Manchester City or Stoke Fulham v Bolton or Tottenham Reading or West Brom v Crystal Palace or Aston Villa Portsmouth v Birmingham Ties to played over the weekend of March 6/7Olympic silver medallist Stephane Lambiel, on the comeback trail after career- threatening injuries, insisted Sunday he has the form to challenge for men's figure skating gold in Vancouver. Even competing will be an achievement for Lambiel, the world champion in 2005 and 2006 who has been plagued by injuries throughout his career. A knee injury hampered his preparation for Turin four years ago and he finally retired two years ago because of a chronic adductor problem. But lured by the dream of gold he returned this season, finishing runner-up behind Olympic champion Yevgeny Plushenko in last month's Europeans. "To come back after an injury is not an easy step," said the 24-year-old. "When I first started to practise for this adventure it was hard to be able to believe that I was going to be where I am today. "Before it was a knee injury and two years before the Olympics I had surgery and you could deal with it. "But this is a chronic injury. I lost the belief that I was able to be healthy. After that I re-centred my goals, and step by step I've been able to construct something. "Every day is a new challenge to stay healthy." Lambiel is one of former four world champions competing in Vancouver. And he believes he can challenge rivals including Plushenko, reigning world champion Evan Lysacek and France's former world champion Brian Joubert. The skater known for his incredible spins has not made his task easy with fast- moving routines to Rossini's William Tell in the short programme and La Traviata in the free skate. "There are no breaks in between the elements," he said of his free skate. "I'm skating all the time, it takes a lot of energy to keep moving and going. "I'm planning to do two quads in the long (programme) and the combo quadruple triple in the short programme." The flag bearer for the Swiss team at the opening ceremony, he said was hoping to use that energy to get him through. "The situation is a bit different from four years ago. I'm older and a bit wiser," he said. "In Torino there was crazy pressure and excitment. Here it's just to enjoy. It's probably my last Olympics, I just want to enjoy every second. "I feel I can really, really push myself to something. I think there's an improvement in what I showed to the crowd in 2006. "Everything is good physically. All that is left is the last step of that pyramid that we've constructed."The Spanish Athletics Federation (RFEA) has suspended 20k walker Francisco "Paquillo" Fernandez following his admission of possessing a banned substance. On Wednesday, the 2004 Olympic silver medallist said he had told police and sports authorities that he had acquired the substance, reported in the Spanish media to be EPO. He said he had not consumed it. In a statement issued Thursday, RFEA said it had suspended Fernandez from competition with immediate effect, with the details of his sanction to be confirmed. Fernandez was investigated in November as part of Operation Grial, an anti-doping raid in which 11 people were arrested.European Union ambassadors on Wednesday warned Albania that a month-long political stalemate was endangering the country's European ties. "The EU perspective for Albania is at stake," said Manuel Montobbio de Balanzo, the ambassador of Spain, which currently holds the EU rotating presidency. The EU ambassadors in Tirana met Wednesday to boost Albanian political leaders' efforts to end the political stalemate. The socialist-led opposition has been boycotting parliament ever since June after they contested the results of parliamentary elections. The boycott means that many much needed reforms are blocked for the time being. The socialists are demanding a parliamentary probe into the elections, including a recount of votes, but Prime Minister Sali Berisha's ruling coalition have rejected this. Albanian President Bamir Topi has pressured Berisha and opposition leader Edi Rama to try to find a solution but both leaders are sticking to their positions, according to sources from the two parties. A Council of Europe mission is expected in Albania in the coming days to discuss the political crisis, diplomatic sources in Tirana said.Anastazia Kuzmina of Slovakia won her first Olympic gold medal Saturday with a victory in the women's 7.5-kilometer biathlon sprint. Kuzmina missed one of 10 shots and finished in 19 minutes, 55.6 seconds on the course that had to be sprinkled with fertilizer to harden up the snow that had been pelted for days with rain and sleet. Magdalena Neuner of Germany took the silver, finishing 1.5 seconds behind Kuzmina, and Marie Dorin of France won the bronze with a clean shoot that put her 10.9 seconds off the lead.Facing criticism that President Barack Obama isn't connecting with the American people, the administration is infusing its communications strategy with some of the ironclad discipline and outside-the-box thinking that made the Obama presidential campaign so successful. Sensitive about talk that the president was sometimes overexposed during his first year in office, the White House now is more discriminating about how and when the president deals with media -- and about whom he talks to when he does. Aides say there's no formal reevaluation of the administration's communications strategy as the president embarks on his second year in office. But with Obama's poll numbers flat-lining, his agenda on the ropes and Democrats increasingly worried about losing ground in November's election when control of Congress will be at stake, the White House is taking an approach to getting out the message about the president's accomplishments and goals that is at once more aggressive and more streamlined. That includes: -- More direct rapid response to criticism. Through blog postings on the White House Web site by a small cast of Obama aides and unsolicited e-mails from press secretary Robert Gibbs blasted to the White House's vast press list, the administration seeks to more quickly and widely counter perceived misinformation. And Gibbs has finally resorted to Twitter. -- More events at which the president speaks directly to the public without the filter of the media, including town hall meetings around the country or such events as a recent online question-and-answer session streamed on YouTube and a televised live exchange with House Republicans. -- Carefully choreographed interactions with the press. Unlike news conferences that are unscripted and can cover many topics and put reporters in competition with the president for the spotlight, the Obama team is trying to place a premium on its media interactions. It's an approach similar to the one employed successfully by the Obama campaign during the 2008 presidential race. "We ran everything through one strategic filter -- how does this help us win the election?" said White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer, who held the same title during the campaign. "Anything that didn't help us do that, we didn't do." Pfeiffer said it's been more difficult to achieve that level of discipline in the White House, where there are not only looming elections to worry about, but talks with lawmakers on Capitol Hill, allies in the international community and a bigger, less close-knit staff. One senior White House official said aides increasingly are focused on using the president's time more efficiently and more strategically. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal White House discussions. The emphasis on impact is reflected in the 10 interviews Obama has chosen to do so far this year -- three with high-profile television anchors, including an interview with CBS News anchor Katie Couric that was broadcast live before the Super Bowl; four interviews with prominent national magazines; a national radio interview, and the online YouTube interview that incorporated questions from the public. The 10th interview, with the Bloomberg subsidiary Business Week, was the only one the president has done this year with a reporter who regularly covers the White House, a group often more familiar than anchors or other high-wattage interviewers with the daily ups and downs of the president and his policies. Aides insist that the focus on high-impact interviews doesn't mean the president is avoiding the White House press corps. Several reporters from news organizations that regularly cover the White House, including The Associated Press, were among the 161 interviews Obama gave in his first year in office -- more than three times the number granted by former President George W. Bush, for instance. But the White House has been willing to circumvent some of the traditional communications channels that long have defined the relationship between the president and the media. The president went nearly seven months without a formal news conference before making a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room last week. Obama also has been less willing of late to answer questions in informal settings. Pfeiffer said the White House is simply trying to update itself to reflect modern times and technology. So that means going to Web-only publications such as the liberal Talking Points Memo and also using Facebook and specialty magazines and TV outlets. "The fundamental structure of communications at the White House and the outlets for presidential communication were largely the same when we came to office as they were when Jimmy Carter came to office," he said. Still, Pfeiffer acknowledged that even the administration's best efforts can accomplish only so much. "There is no communications strategy that makes 10 percent unemployment look good," he said.Lynn Pascoe, special envoy of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, met with Kim Yong Nam, president of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and delivered a verbal message from the UN chief, as well as a leather-bound copy of the UN Charter, a UN spokesman said here Thursday. "The gift -- this is a standard UN and indeed diplomatic protocol," UN spokesman Martin Nesirky said here at UN Headquarters in New York. "Gifts are given on such visits." "This was a leather-bound copy of the United Nations Charter in all six official languages," he said, referring to Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish -- the six official languages in the world body. Pascoe, the UN undersecretary-general for political affairs, is the first high- level UN official to visit the DPRK since 2004. When asked about the verbal message from Ban, Nesirky said he could not comment on the exchange. Pascoe and the other three members of the delegation are in Pyongyang until Friday and would then leave for Beijing, Seoul and Tokyo, Nesirky said. Upon his arrival at Pyongyang's international airport Tuesday, Pascoe told Xinhua that he and DPRK officials would mainly discuss ways to enhance cooperation between the United Nations and the DPRK.Australia great Shane Warne has accused Andrew Strauss of showing a "lack of respect for Test cricket" following the England captain's decision to opt out of the tour of Bangladesh. Warne, speaking at Lord's here on Monday, said Strauss's absence for next month's two-Test series, when England are due to be captained by another opening batsman in Alastair Cook, would store up trouble for his side. Strauss's place could be taken by Michael Carberry and after helping the 29 -year-old revive his career when captain of Hampshire, leg-spin legend Warne said he would like nothing more than to see his former county colleague give the selectors a huge headache. "I hope they are not taking Bangladesh too easy because they can be quite strong," Warne said. "What if they (Bangladesh) win the first Test? Does Strauss fly out for the second? I hope it's not the start of a trend. It's a lack of respect for Test cricket. "It's disappointing that the captain of England decides to have a rest from a Test series, I can't comprehend that. Any time you represent your country it's special and I cannot understand how you can rest your captain. "Maybe a one-day game because you play 40 or 50 a year but you only play eight Test matches a year. It's special. "He's got a style of captaincy and a new skipper can't be Andrew Strauss, he'll do it his way. So suddenly the players think 'how are we going to play under Alastair Cook?'" Strauss's decision has already provoked debate with many observers wondering why he needs to take a break during the Bangladesh tour given he is also set to miss the World Twenty20 in the Caribbean in April and March as he does not play in international cricket's shortest format. Carberry, yet to make his Test debut, received a ringing endorsement from his old captain. "I hope he gets the nod and peels off a couple of hundreds," Warne said. "Then what are they going to do? Leave Andrew Strauss out? Michael is a wonderful player and I had a lot to do with him down at Hampshire where I was his captain for a few years. I saw a lot of good qualities and he just got better and better." John Terry's sacking as captain of the England football team, following reports of an affair with the ex-girlfriend of a former team-mate, has once again thrown the spotlight onto sportsmen's private lives. Warne, axed as Australia vice-captain in 2000 after an off-the-field scandal, was asked for his views on the Terry controversy on BBC radio prior to arriving at Lord's for the launch of the Royals 2020 franchise. "The best thing about a captain is to be honest with your players, understand the players and get the best out of the group," he said. Earlier, England fast bowler Stephen Harmison agreed Strauss, who led England in their recent 1-1 series draw away to South Africa, should tour Bangladesh. "The captain should be there," the Durham quick told Sky Sports. "He was tired at the end of the South Africa tour but the other factor is he's England captain. Even if he got there two days before the first Test, the England captain should be there."Results from the fifth day of the WTA Paris Indoor Open here on Thursday (x denotes seeding): Quarter-finals Elena Dementieva (RUS x1) bt Andrea Petkovic (GER) 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 Lucie Safarova (CZE) bt Shahar Peer (ISR x6) 6-3, 6-0 Flavia Pennetta (ITA x2) bt Tathiana Garbin (ITA) 6-1, 6-3A museum curator says that new color video footage showing President John F. Kennedy's arrival in Dallas the day he was assassinated is the best home movie ever made of the event. Sixth Floor Museum curator Gary Mack says that the short clip, shot on 8mm film by a 15-year-old student, makes you feel as though you were there. The museum put the film on display for public viewing on Monday. Kennedy was killed Nov. 22, 1963, as his motorcade made its way through downtown Dallas. The newly released footage shot by 61-year-old Dallas businessman William Ward Warren mainly shows Air Force One and Air Force Two arriving, and briefly features the Kennedys making their way through the crowd at the airport. Warren says he had largely forgotten about the footage until recently. ------ Associated Press Videojournalist Rich Matthews and Associated Press Writer Jamie Stengle contributed to this report. ------ On the Net: The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza: http://jfk.org/A crab boat captain who dodged danger for decades in the Bering Sea succumbed to a more common American ailment. Phil Harris, 53, made famous on a Discovery Channel reality show, the "Deadliest Catch," died Tuesday. Harris suffered a stroke last month at a remote Alaska port and was flown to Anchorage for treatment. Family members had reported he was making progress. His sons, Josh and Jake Harris, who accompanied their father on fishing trips aboard the Cornelia Marie, released a statement that Harris had always been a fighter and continued to be until the end. Phil Harris acknowledged that steering a boat into some of the planet's most hostile waters was not for everyone. "You've got to be a little bit twisted to do this job," he said on the eve of one departure. The raspy-voiced skipper, often filmed with a cigarette in hand, suffered cracked or broken ribs in the show's fourth season when a storm tossed him out of bed and onto the sharp table corner. He left the Cornelia Marie for treatment and was recorded recuperating in Seattle, spitting up blood, the result of a blood clot that had passed through his heart. He wistfully noted he might have to find something else to do. "The bad part of it is, I don't know if my fishing career is over, and that's going to be a devastating thing for me if it is," he said on camera. Harris was back on the Cornelia Marie last month when he suffered a stroke Jan. 29 in port at St. Paul Island, the largest of the five islands in the Pribilofs, 300 miles (480 kilometers) off Alaska's west coast and 750 miles (1,200 kilometers) west of Anchorage. Commercial fishing statistically remains the most hazardous occupation in America, said Jerry Dzugan, director of the Alaska Marine Safety Education Association and a former halibut and salmon fisherman in Alaska's Panhandle. An average of 11 fishermen in Alaska waters have been lost annually the last five years, he said. However, that's a fraction of the 36 to 40 lost annually before passage of revised federal safety laws. "The safety culture has changed in commercial fishing the last 20 years to a profound degree as the result of losses and as a result of regulations and as a result of fishermen seeing that required safety equipment works," he said. About the same proportion of boats now sink, but most of the crew survive. Last year, nine fishermen died, said Jennifer Lincoln of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Heath. Eight were washed overboard and just one was a crabber, a crewman who got tangled in a line. In the 1990s, an average of eight lives were lost annually in the crab fleet, most when vessels sank. Just one crab boat has gone down since the Coast Guard, working with fishermen, instituted dockside safety and stability checks in 1999 to prevent overloading, which causes boats to be top heavy or unstable. "By the time the 'Deadliest Catch' TV show was aired, crab fishing in the Bering Sea was no longer the deadliest catch," Dzugan said, adding that the deadliest U.S. fishery now is crab fishing off Oregon and Washington. Dzugan did not minimize the danger faced by Harris and fellow crabbers who work through winter storms, often staying awake more than 24 hours straight, hoisting and emptying 850-pound crab "pots" and trying to stay upright on wet or icy decks without getting tangled in lines. "It's amazing that you don't have more fatalities," he said. ------ On The Net:Attorney General Eric Holder is leaving open the possibility of trying professed Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed before a military commission instead of the civilian trial originally planned for New York City. "At the end of the day, wherever this case is tried, in whatever forum, what we have to ensure is that it's done as transparently as possible and with adherence to all the rules," Holder told The Washington Post in an interview published in Friday's editions. "If we do that, I'm not sure the location or even the forum is as important as what the world sees in that proceeding." Opposition from New York officials has forced the Obama administration to reconsider plans to put Mohammed on trial in federal court in lower Manhattan, near where the World Trade Center was felled after it was hit by hijacked airliners. City and state officials and many congressional Republicans argue that the high-security trial would put New Yorkers at risk of further attacks, cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in security expenses and take a staggering toll on nearby businesses. Holder still maintains that a civilian trial would be the best option for the case and "best for our overall fight against al-Qaida." President Barack Obama said in a CBS television interview that he has not ruled out holding the trial in New York federal court but was taking into account the objections of Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the city's police.Swiss ski jumper Simon Ammann won the first gold medal on offer at the Vancouver Olympics with victory in the normal hill event on Saturday. Polish veteran Adam Malysz took silver and 20-year-old Gregor Schlierenzauer of Austria recovered from a disappointing first jump to earn bronze on his Olympic debut. Ammann showed his mastery of the smaller hill at Whistler's Olympic Park with the longest jumps in both rounds -- he took a commanding lead with a 105-meter effort and then soared 108 meters with his second jump for a total score of 276.5 points. He knew right away he was the winner, pumping his arm in celebration before raising two clenched fists into the air. Ammann also swept both individual events at the 2002 Salt Lake Olympics, where Malysz was second in the large hill. Malysz, a four-time individual world champion who is still looking for his first Olympic gold medal, had been third after the first round and finished with 269.5 points. Schlierenzauer seemed to mistime his takeoff in the first round and squandered his chance for a gold with a mediocre 101.5-meter jump, but climbed from seventh to third after soaring 106.5 meters in the second. Michael Uhrmann of Germany was a surprising second after the first round, but only managed 102 meters in the second to miss the podium.The African Union urged the military in coup-prone Nigeria on Thursday to respect a decision to hand power to the country's deputy leader until the recovery of ailing President Umaru Yar'Adua. In a statement, African Union commission chairman Jean Ping praised the move to install Goodluck Jonathan as acting head-of-state for demonstrating "respect for the constitution, good governance, democracy and the rule of law". "In so doing, the government and people of Nigeria have, again, resolved a delicate and sensitive political situation within the constitutional and legal provisions available and without recourse to violence or unconstitutional means," the statement added. "The chairperson of the commission encourages all the stakeholders in Nigeria, including the military, to continue in their firm support for and practice of constitutionality." Nigeria's cabinet had initially opposed the idea of the vice president being formally appointed as acting head of state in the absence of Yar'Adua who has been treated in a Saudi Arabia hospital for a heart condition since November. But ministers rallied round Jonathan on Wedesday, the day after both houses of parliament had voted to hand him the reins of power. Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation and one of the world's biggest oil exporters, has a long history of coups and mililtary leadership, and only returned to civilian rule a little over a decade ago. After his installation as acting president, Jonathan commended the security services for "their loyalty and devotion to duty during this trying period". The debate around the crisis arising from Yar'Adua's absence has brought to the fore the political battle over the delicate power balancing act in Nigeria. The situation in Nigeria is further complicated by an unwritten rule under which the presidency traditionally switches between the north and the south at every two elections. Yar'Adua is from the predominantly Muslim north and Jonathan from the mainly Christian south.Fabio Capello, coach of England international team, admitted that Ashley Cole's injury was a sad news for his preparations for the South Africa World Cup. Chelsea and England left-back Ashley Cole was ruled out for three months on Thursday with a broken ankle, leaving the defender a major doubt for England's World Cup squad. "It is sad news for me because he is a very important player. He is good when he defending and really dangerous when we go forward. I hope this problem will not be so serious," said an anxious Capello. If Cole can not find his form in time before the World Cup, Capello would have to rely on Wayne Bridge as the replacement for Cole. Given the alleged affair of center-back John Terry with the former girlfriend of Bridge, how to handle the relations between the two defenders would be a tricky problem for Capello.Mary MacKillop, a nun revered for her work with needy children as much as for her rebellious streak, is to become Australia's first Roman Catholic saint on October 17, Pope Benedict XVI said Friday. The pope announced the date at a consistory or meeting of cardinals at the Vatican. In December, Benedict recognised a miracle in which MacKillop apparently cured a woman of cancer, paving the way for the canonisation of a nun who is already a national icon in Australia. MacKillop, who died in 1909, passed the first stage to sainthood when pope John Paul II beatified her in 1995 after recognising a first miracle attributed to her, in which a woman was said to have been cured of terminal leukaemia. Melbourne-born MacKillop established her first school in a disused stable and founded an order of nuns at the age of 24. MacKillop, whose parents came to Australia from Scotland, spent her life educating the poor, taking learning to the harsh outback. But the pioneering educator and social reformer was not without controversy -- MacKillop was excommunicated in 1871 for alleged insubordination before being welcomed back to the Church four months later. She later sought pope Pius IX's approval to continue her work with her order and by the time of her death aged 67 in 1909, MacKillop led 750 nuns, ran 117 schools and had opened orphanages and refuges for the needy.British Prime Minister Gordon Brown on Friday joined other leaders in congratulating Viktor Yanukovych on winning Ukraine's presidential election, despite his pro-West rival's refusal to concede. "I congratulate Mr. Yanukovych on his victory," Brown said in a statement, adding that the polls were "a vigorous display of democracy" and that international observers said it was free and fair. "The UK has long supported Ukraines EU aspirations and we will continue to do so. A broader EU is a stronger EU, and will make for a stronger, and more prosperous Britain." he added. Brown's comments follow congratulations by US President Barack Obama and NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen, while the European Union said it remains committed to deepening the relationship with Ukraine." Ukraine's political class has in the past aspired to join the EU and the world's biggest military alliance despite a lack of public support for the move and objections from Russia. Yanukovych, who beat Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko by almost 3.5 percent in Sunday's vote, has made ties with Russia a priority and is much cooler on EU and NATO membership than his predecessor. On Thursday Yanukovych's rival, Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko made her first comments, slamming Yanukovych but still defying mounting pressure to concede.Finance ministers from the 16 countries that share the euro on Monday picked Portugal's Vitor Constancio for the key job of deputy head of the European Central Bank, a European source said. Constancio, 66, succeeds Greece's Lucas Papademos in May, in a decision seen as likely to leave the field open for Bundesbank chief Axel Weber to succeed Jean- Claude Trichet as ECB president in October next year. A former socialist lawmaker and party leader, Constancio has been governor of Portugal's central bank since 2000 after a first stint at the helm between 1985 and 1986. Convention dictates that a balance is found between northern and southern European countries when it comes to the allocation of prized top jobs in European institutions. Germany, Europe's biggest country and most powerful economy, has been lobbying hard for Weber to take the reins after Trichet. Weber will be competing against Italian central bank chief Mario Draghi. Constancio's selection is due to be confirmed on Tuesday during a meeting of finance ministers from all 27 nations, although only the 16 that share the single currency are expected to vote. Leaders will then formally announce his nomination during a summit in March.The White House Friday left open the option of abandoning plans to bring suspected September 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed before a civil court, amid an outcry over a planned trial in New York. Top officials also said that President Barack Obama would become more personally involved in the high-stakes political decision on where to conduct the trial, as efforts to block a civilian case gather pace in Congress. The Sheikh Mohammed trial is the latest attempt by the administration to clear up the Bush administration's legal legacy from the war on terror to become embroiled in a fierce political row. Doubts over the planned civil court of Sheikh Mohammed were first fanned by Attorney General Eric Holder in an interview published on Friday. Then, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs declined to definitively rule out the option of trying Mohammed, who is now at the US prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, before a military commission instead of a civilian court. "There are a series of things that are being looked at, most appropriately the security and logistical concerns of those in New York, as a decision is being made," Gibbs said. Holder told the Post in an interview published on Friday that "wherever this case is tried, in whatever forum, what we have to ensure is that it's done as transparently as possible and with adherence to all the rules." "If we do that, I'm not sure the location or even the forum is as important as what the world sees in that proceeding." Gibbs also trod a careful line in describing Obama's increasing involvement in the political imbroglio over the trial, following Holder's initial decision to hold it in Manhattan, near the site of the World Trade Center attack. He said that the decision was correctly left to the Justice Department, but that Obama was becoming involved as efforts mounted on Capitol Hill to withdraw funding for a civilian trial. "The White House and by definition the president are involved," Gibbs said, but downplaying the extent to which Obama was immersing himself in detailed legal and scheduling decisions. "He's not in the Map Room with a big map, picking a location." Holder made clear to the Post, however, that a military trial of Mohammed was neither his personal nor legal preference. On Sunday, during a CBS interview, Obama appeared to take ownership of the issue, noting the rising opposition in New York to a trial near the site of the 2001 attacks. "I have not ruled it out, but I think it is important for us to take into account the practical logistical issues involved," Obama said. "If you have got a city that is saying no, and a police department that is saying no, and a mayor that is saying no, that makes it difficult," Obama said. But he added: "We have not ruled out anything -- we will make a definitive judgement based on consultations with all the relevant authorities."Apolo Anton Ohno hardly seems burdened by the weight of Olympic history. As he circled the track time and time again at Pacific Coliseum on Friday, he couldn't seem to stop yawning. Even as he prepared to practice the harrowing relay exchange -- which looks something akin to the finish of a stock car race, with all sorts of bumping and drafting -- Ohno's mouth was agape for several seconds, as if he could barely stay awake. Then, suddenly, he swerved onto the track, pushed off on those short, powerful legs and -- whoosh! -- he was gone. Next stop, the record book. When short track begins Saturday night at this 32-year-old arena in Hastings Park, Ohno will attempt to become the most decorated Olympic skater in the history of this thrilling, high-speed sport. He already has five medals from Salt Lake City and Turin -- no one has ever won six. That's not all. Ohno also will be attempting to tie the mark for the most medals ever by a U.S. Winter Olympian, and he'll have four chances in the next 2 1/2 weeks to zip right on by Bonnie Blair, who won five golds and a bronze over her three Olympics. Ohno has two golds, a silver and two bronze medals in his collection. "I am ready. No regrets, no fears, no hesitation," he tweeted after the hourlong workout, his final prep for the 1,500 meters. "Enjoying every minute. I'll give my all for USA. And smile every step of the way." He breezed through the mixed zone, flashing a smile for reporters but not taking time to stop. He's got his game face on now, and he hopes his next comments to the media will come with another gold medal hanging from his neck. "Apolo is such a great example for our everyone, whether you're an athlete or a student or a businessman because he just has this amazing drive," teammate Katherine Reutter said. "He will not give up. He will do everything to his best and his fullest. That's why he's a champion. Whether he gets one more medal or not -- and I think he will -- he'll always be a champion and a legend in our sport." While the 27-year-old Ohno is the oldest member of the U.S. short track team and finds himself competing against teenagers, he's still on top of his game. He's a medal contender in all four events, ready to go up against stiff competition from Canada's Charles Hamelin and the powerful South Korean team. "This year, he's way better than any other year," said U.S. national coach Jimmy Jang, a close friend of Ohno's off the ice. "His condition is perfect now." Not that he's the same skater. After the Turin Games, Ohno took some time off, then set out to completely alter his style of skating with help from Jang. It was difficult to pull off, persuading the body to do things it wasn't accustomed to doing, but Jang said it was a necessary step to keep up with mostly younger skaters. Whereas Ohno may not have the power to simply blow by someone on the final turn, he's much more aware of positioning, angles and setting up his opponents for the pass. "We changed everything for technique and body weight," Jang said. "He was a power skater before. Now he's a technical skater. Totally different." While Ohno jokingly calls himself "Grandpa" and seems not to have a care in the world, no one works harder or gets more out of his talent. "I think he's just smarter," Reutter said. "I know this World Cup season, he had really hard training all the way through. But you can see it in practice. He's going faster, he's going longer. All the training and work is really paying off. Maybe what he's lost in age he's gained in wisdom and strength and strategy." Even though the Americans are counting on one of their deepest teams in years to keep up with the Koreans, Chinese and Canadians, there's little doubt who stands apart -- and not just because he's the only member of the U.S. team wearing a red helmet. "He's always been the leader," said J.R. Celski, 19. "He's been the big dog, the face of short track." Ohno hasn't lost any of his drive, either. A few months ago, when he felt Jang's focus was lagging a bit, he e-mailed the coach a picture of them hugging after Ohno won gold in the 500 at the Turin Games. "You need to wake up again," Ohno quipped. "We need another gold." While he's indicated this will be his final Olympics, Jang sees no reason for Ohno to hang up his 18-inch blades. "I told him, 'We need one more Olympics,'" Jang said. Now, if he can just stop yawning. "Isn't that funny?" Reutter said. "I've asked him about it and he says he doesn't even know he does it. Hey, if that's what gets him ready to go, more power to him."Australia great Shane Warne has accused Andrew Strauss of showing a "lack of respect for Test cricket" following the England captain's decision to opt out of the tour of Bangladesh. Warne, speaking at Lord's here on Monday, said Strauss's absence for next month's two-Test series, when England are due to be captained by another opening batsman in Alastair Cook, would store up trouble for his side. Strauss's place could be taken by Michael Carberry and after helping the 29 -year-old revive his career when captain of Hampshire, leg-spin legend Warne said he would like nothing more than to see his former county colleague give the selectors a huge headache. "I hope they are not taking Bangladesh too easy because they can be quite strong," Warne said. "What if they (Bangladesh) win the first Test? Does Strauss fly out for the second? I hope it's not the start of a trend. It's a lack of respect for Test cricket. "It's disappointing that the captain of England decides to have a rest from a Test series, I can't comprehend that. Any time you represent your country it's special and I cannot understand how you can rest your captain. "Maybe a one-day game because you play 40 or 50 a year but you only play eight Test matches a year. It's special. "He's got a style of captaincy and a new skipper can't be Andrew Strauss, he'll do it his way. So suddenly the players think 'how are we going to play under Alastair Cook?'" Strauss's decision has already provoked debate with many observers wondering why he needs to take a break during the Bangladesh tour given he is also set to miss the World Twenty20 in the Caribbean in April and March as he does not play in international cricket's shortest format. Carberry, yet to make his Test debut, received a ringing endorsement from his old captain. "I hope he gets the nod and peels off a couple of hundreds," Warne said. "Then what are they going to do? Leave Andrew Strauss out? Michael is a wonderful player and I had a lot to do with him down at Hampshire where I was his captain for a few years. I saw a lot of good qualities and he just got better and better." John Terry's sacking as captain of the England football team, following reports of an affair with the ex-girlfriend of a former team-mate, has once again thrown the spotlight onto sportsmen's private lives. Warne, axed as Australia vice-captain in 2000 after an off-the-field scandal, was asked for his views on the Terry controversy on BBC radio prior to arriving at Lord's for the launch of the Royals 2020 franchise. "The best thing about a captain is to be honest with your players, understand the players and get the best out of the group," he said. Earlier, England fast bowler Stephen Harmison agreed Strauss, who led England in their recent 1-1 series draw away to South Africa, should tour Bangladesh. "The captain should be there," the Durham quick told Sky Sports. "He was tired at the end of the South Africa tour but the other factor is he's England captain. Even if he got there two days before the first Test, the England captain should be there."Slovak First Deputy Prime Minister Dusan Caplovic arrived here Monday for a six- day visit to China. Making the visit at the invitation of Chinese Vice Premier Li Keqiang, Caplovic will hold talks with Li in Beijing and will visit China's southernmost island province of Hainan. It is Caplovic's first visit to China since he took office in 2006. China and Slovakia have enjoyed traditional friendship and maintained high-level contacts. Chinese President Hu Jintao paid a successful visit to Slovakia in June 2009 as the two countries marked the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties.Frank Thomas announced his retirement Friday following a 19-season Major League Baseball career that included 521 home runs and two American League MVP awards with the Chicago White Sox. The news wasn't unexpected, considering the 41-year-old didn't play last season. "It took awhile to get to this point," Thomas said. "I know I hadn't played since 2008, but I had to get baseball out of my system before I made this announcement. I'm happy with this announcement. I'm at peace with it. I had one heck of a career. I'm proud of it." With his power and ability to hit for a high average and reach base, Thomas seems headed to the Hall of Fame when he becomes eligible. The five-time All-Star batted .301 with a .419 on-base average and is tied for 18th with Ted Williams and Willie McCovey on baseball's home run list. He also drove in 1,704 runs, and in an era clouded by performance-enhancing drugs, he was outspoken against their use. Thomas divided his final three seasons between Oakland and Toronto, but he'll be remembered most for his 16-year spell with the White Sox. After his debut in 1990, he won Most Valuable Player honors in 1993 and 1994 and the batting title in 1997. He set White Sox records for home runs (448) and RBIs (1,465) before an acrimonious split in the wake of the 2005 World Series-winning season. Thomas ended up going to Oakland and hit 39 homers with 114 RBIs in 2006 before signing an 18.12 million-dollar, two-year contract with Toronto. The Blue Jays released him early in the 2008 season and he returned to Oakland, playing 55 games before his season ended because of a right thigh injury.President Barack Obama will meet with the Dalai Lama at the White House next week. The long-anticipated meeting set for Feb. 18 is likely to enflame tensions between China and the United States. China accuses the Dalai Lama of pushing for Tibetan independence and believes that shunning the exiled Tibetan monk should be a basic principle of international relations. Obama has been under intense pressure to meet with the Dalai Lama after putting off a meeting in October. U.S. officials said at the time that Tibet could be better addressed in a November summit between Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao if Chinese leaders weren't furious over a recent meeting between the Dalai Lama and Obama.China's foreign ministry has urged the United States to immediately cancel plans for President Barack Obama to meet with the Dalai Lama next week, warning the move could further hurt ties. Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu issued the remarks Friday, hours after Washington announced Obama would meet with the Tibetan spiritual leader at the White House on Feb. 18. China accuses the Dalai Lama of pushing for Tibetan independence and believes that shunning the exiled Tibetan monk should be a basic principle of international relations. Ma says the US should cancel the meeting "so as not to cause further damage to Sino-US relations." Obama has been under intense pressure to meet with the Dalai Lama after putting off a meeting in October.Results here on Friday on the fifth day of the Rotterdam ATP tennis tournament: Quarter-finals Robin Soderling (SWE x4) bt Julien Benneteau (FRA) 6-0, 6-1 Novak Djokovic (SRB/N.1) bat Florian Mayer (GER) par forfait Nikolay Davydenko (RUS/N.2) bat Jurgen Melzer (AUT) 6-3, 6-2Bangladesh's main opposition party in parliament Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) on Tuesday declared a nation-wide demonstration program in protest of the government's decision to rename the country's main Zia International Airport. As per the program, Senior Joint Secretary General of the party, Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, told reporters at a press briefing Tuesday, "BNP will bring out protest rallies in capital Dhaka as well as all district headquarters across the country Thursday." The international airport, which started operation in 1980, was named Zia (Ziaur Rahman) International Airport in 1983. Former President General Ziaur Rahman, who founded BNP on Sept. 1, 1978, served his tenure from 1977 to 1981 and was assassinated in May 1981. The Bangladesh Awami League-led grand alliance government, which completed over one year in office, Monday in a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina decided to rename the establishments named after Ziaur Rahman including the Zia International Airport, which is to be named now Hazrat Shahjalal ( R), a great Muslim saint of 14 century, International Airport. The BNP senior joint secretary general Alamgir said, "It seemed the government is going towards a one-party rule in the country by renaming the Zia International Airport and torturing the opposition leaders and activists." He said Thursday's demonstration program has also been taken demanding adequate security for BNP chairperson and also former prime minister Khaleda Zia, widow of late president Ziaur Rahman, and protesting price hike of essentials in the country. Bangladeshi Police Monday morning recovered two firecrackers wrapped in scotch tape near the country's two-time former prime minister Khaleda Zia's office in the capital Dhaka.Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko Thursday broke more than three days of silence after her defeat in presidential elections, slamming her rival but still defying mounting pressure to concede. Speaking before a cabinet meeting with her golden hair braid tied as usual on her head, Tymoshenko made no mention of the election result and instead accused winning candidate Viktor Yanukovych of deceiving Ukraine with promises. Yanukovych beat Tymoshenko by almost 3.5 percent in Sunday's vote but the prime minister's party has alleged that substantial fraud casts doubt on the outcome, raising fears of a prolonged political crisis in the country. However international observers and Western states hailed the vote as fair and clean. With political tensions showing no sign of slackening, thousands of Yanukovych supporters maintained a picket outside the central election commission Thursday with the aim of ensuring the results were not changed. "Today it is clear that no one from the Yanukovych team is intending to raise social standards. This was just PR," Tymoshenko told her cabinet. "Already after the elections, the deceptions of the campaign are starting up again and people need to take this into account in their future political decisions," she added. The last public comments by Tymoshenko had been on Sunday night after the publication of exit polls. She subsequently disappeared from public view. Tymoshenko made no comment on the elections themselves. But the very fact of holding a cabinet meeting will be seen as an act of defiance after Yanukovych told her to acknowledge the will of the people and resign as prime minister. The deputy head of Yanukovych's Regions Party, Borys Kolesnykov, warned that if Tymoshenko did not step down voluntarily "she will be removed". "And that could happen in the near future," he said. But the prime minister's right-hand man Olexander Turchynov said the government had no intention of resigning. "The government will resign of its own accord only if parliament is changed (after elections). As far as I know there has been no news about this." Respected Internet newspaper Ukrainska Pravda earlier this week reported that Tymoshenko had told her party she would never recognise the legitimacy of Yanukovych. The rally by Yanukovych supporters outside the central election commission has been maintained since the results came out, attended mainly by supporters from his eastern Ukrainian strongholds. Quoting the interior ministry, Interfax said 2,500 supporters were bussed into Kiev from the regions Thursday to provide reinforcements for the rally. Tymoshenko was one of the leaders of the 2004 Orange Revolution that sparked hopes of a new start in the ex-Soviet country bordering the EU and Russia but whose ambitions crumbled amid political infighting and an economic crisis. Yanukovych has long been seen as a pro-Kremlin figure and was accused of staging the vote-rigging in the 2004 presidential elections that sparked the Orange uprising. Unusually, international observers including the OSCE implicitly told Tymoshenko to concede by saying Ukraine's leaders had to listen to the "people's verdict". But although the United States has praised the conduct of the elections, it has yet to congratulate Yanukovych.Taiwan's top national security aide to President Ma Ying-jeou, announced his surprise resignation Thursday, citing family and health reasons. National Security Council (NSC) Secretary-General Su Chi, who had recently faced harsh criticism for his inept handling of the U.S. beef import controversy, made the announcement at a hastily called press conference at the Presidential Office. He declined to take questions from the media and left the Presidential Office immediately after reading his resignation statement. Ma immediately accepted Su's resignation, Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu- chi said after Su's remarks. The president recognized Su's contributions to the promotion of relations with the United States, China and Japan in the 20 months since Ma took office, Wang said. Hu Wei-jen, Taiwan's former representative to Singapore and to Germany, will assume Su's post Feb. 23, Wang said. Hu, a career diplomat, has 35 years of experience in diplomatic and national security affairs, according to the spokesman.Cruzeiro, Corinthians and Flamengo all had victories to in the Copa Libertadores group stage on Wednesday to push the claims of Brazilian clubs in the tournament . Corinthians beat a ten-man Racing of Uruguay 2-1 at home, while Adriano scored Flamengo's second goal in a 2-0 home win against Universidad Catolica of Chile. Earlier, fellow Brazilian club Cruzeiro won 4-1 at home against nine-man Colo Colo of Chile, while Peru's Juan Aurich had a 2-0 home victory over Bolivar of Bolivia. Mexican club Monterrey hosts Nacional of Paraguay later Wednesday. The results mean Corinthians tops Group 1, while Flamengo joins Universidad de Chile at the top of Group 8 after the first round of fixtures in both groups. Cruzeiro sits second behind Velez Sarsfield of Argentina in Group 7, and Juan Aurich is third in Group 3, after two games played in each section. The Copa Libertadores is the top club competition in Latin America. The eight group winners plus six best placed runners-up will qualify for the knockout round of 16.China urged the United States on Friday to immediately cancel plans for President Barack Obama to meet with the Dalai Lama next week, warning the move could further hurt ties. Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu issued the remarks hours after Washington announced Obama would meet with the Tibetan spiritual leader at the White House on Feb. 18. China accuses the Dalai Lama of pushing for Tibetan independence, which the Dalai Lama denies, and believes that shunning the exiled Tibetan monk should be a basic principle of international relations. Obama has been under intense pressure to meet with the Dalai Lama after putting off a meeting in October. "We urge the U.S. side to fully understand the high sensitivity of Tibet-related issues, honor its commitment to recognizing Tibet as part of China and opposing 'Tibet independence,'" Ma said. The U.S. should cancel the meeting "so as not to cause further damage to Sino-U.S. relations," Ma said in a statement. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Obama looked forward to an "engaging and constructive dialogue" with the Dalai Lama. Every U.S. president for the last two decades has met with the Dalai Lama, who enjoys widespread support in the United States, and those visits are considered powerful signs of the American commitment to human rights. Obama told China's leaders last year that he would meet with the monk. China-U.S. relations have been strained in recent weeks over several issues: Washington announcing a $6.4 billion arms sale to Taiwan, the self-governing island Beijing claims as its own; U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton urging Beijing to investigate hacking attacks that led to Google's threat to pull out of China; and Obama vowing to get tough with China on a currency dispute.Iranian Nobel peace prize winner and activist Shirin Ebadi on Friday launched an impassioned plea for international help, warning that a tragedy was looming in Iran if a government crackdown continued. "The time has arrived now for the government to listen to the people," she said in Geneva. "Tomorrow will be too late, tomorrow we will face a tragedy in Iran. Please help us," she added, warning of a sharp increase in human rights abuses there. "Please help us to extinguish this fire in our homes," she added. Ebadi was speaking the day after Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards and police reportedly clamped down on opposition protests during the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic revolution which toppled the Western-backed Shah. The 47-nation United Human Rights Council in Geneva is due to publicly scrutinise Iran's overall human rights record on Monday under a regular review process. Ebadi appeared at an event organised by several human rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, to lobby for support ahead of the meeting. On Thursday, as vast crowds massed in central Tehran, security forces attacked opposition leaders Mohammad Khatami and Mehdi Karroubi while clashing with their supporters, an opposition website said. The State Department said US monitoring showed Iran had attempted "a near total information blockade" to deal with the protesters, which a spokesman labelled as an "unprecedented, overwhelming step."British Prime Minister Gordon Brown on Friday joined other leaders in congratulating Viktor Yanukovych on winning Ukraine's presidential election, despite his pro-West rival's refusal to concede. "I congratulate Mr. Yanukovych on his victory," Brown said in a statement, adding that the polls were "a vigorous display of democracy" and that international observers said it was free and fair. "The UK has long supported Ukraines EU aspirations and we will continue to do so. A broader EU is a stronger EU, and will make for a stronger, and more prosperous Britain." he added. Brown's comments follow congratulations by US President Barack Obama and NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen, while the European Union said it remains committed to deepening the relationship with Ukraine." Ukraine's political class has in the past aspired to join the EU and the world's biggest military alliance despite a lack of public support for the move and objections from Russia. Yanukovych, who beat Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko by almost 3.5 percent in Sunday's vote, has made ties with Russia a priority and is much cooler on EU and NATO membership than his predecessor. On Thursday Yanukovych's rival, Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko made her first comments, slamming Yanukovych but still defying mounting pressure to concede.Following are the results from the ATP Rotterdam Open on Thursday (prefix number denotes seeding): Second round 4-Gael Monfils, France, bt Thiemo de Bakker, Netherlands, 6-3, 6-2 6-Mikhail Youzhny, Russia, bt Marsel Ilhan, Turkey, 6-4, 6-4 Julien Benneteau, France, bt Michael Berrer, Germany, 6-4, 6-4 1-Novak Djokovic, Serbia, bt Marco Chiudinelli, Switzerland, 6-4, 6-2A special UN envoy said on Friday he was "very satisfied" after talks with Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) officials. Lynn Pascoe, UN under-secretary-general for political affairs and special envoy of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, made the comment to Xinhua at the airport as he left the DPRK after a four-day visit. When asked whether the nuclear issue was discussed, he answered, "we discussed many problems." During his visit, Pascoe met with the President of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, Kim Yong Nam, and Foreign Minister Pak Ui Chun, according to the official news agency KCNA, which gave no further details of the meetings. Pascoe is the first high-level UN official to visit the country since 2004. The UN Security Council on June 12, 2009, adopted Resolution 1874, which allowed wider sanctions over the DPRK's May 25 nuclear test. The resolution banned all weapons exports from the DPRK and most arms imports into the country, authorized UN member states to inspect the DPRK's sea, air and land cargo and required them to seize and destroy any goods transported in violation of the sanctions. The DPRK has rejected the resolution and announced its withdrawal from the six- party talks aimed at denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.A Japanese lawmaker resigned from the ruling party on Thursday over a funding scandal that has hurt Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama's credibility. Tomohiro Ishikawa, a 36-year-old Democratic Party lawmaker and former aide to party strongman Ichiro Ozawa, announced his resignation in the wake of his indictment by prosecutors last week. Ozawa, the party's secretary general, confirmed the resignation had been accepted, telling reporters: "I believe that he does not want to trouble the party anymore." Japanese prosecutors indicted Ishikawa over accounting irregularities at a political funding group run by Ozawa. But the party kingpin escaped charges as prosecutors said there was a lack of evidence against him. Dubbed the "Shadow Shogun", the 67-year-old Ozawa is credited with engineering the DPJ's election landslide in August that ended more than half a century of almost unbroken conservative rule. The scandal has dented the popularity of the party and Hatoyama, with support ratings for his cabinet now at around 40 percent. Political observers expect the funding scandal to damage the party at upper house elections in July at which the DPJ hopes to secure sole control of both chambers of parliament.Taiwan's top national security aide to President Ma Ying-jeou, announced his surprise resignation Thursday, citing family and health reasons. National Security Council (NSC) Secretary-General Su Chi, who had recently faced harsh criticism for his inept handling of the U.S. beef import controversy, made the announcement at a hastily called press conference at the Presidential Office.

Hu, a career diplomat, has 35 years of experience in diplomatic and national security affairs, according to the spokesman.Spanish 20-kilometer walker Francisco 'Paquillo' Fernandez has said he accepts any sanction he may receive after he admitted possessing a banned substance. The 2004 Olympic silver medalist was banned pending disciplinary procedures after informing sports authorities and police that he had acquired the substance although he said he had not used it. He told reporters on Friday: "I will get my punishment and I am conscious that you have to do things right and I didn't." Fernandez could be suspended from competition for up to two years although he said he hopes to compete in the 2012 Olympics. The athlete was investigated by the Civil Guard as part of Operation Grial which saw 11 people arrested in November.Russia believes sanctions against Iran are necessary under certain circumstances, a deputy foreign minister said in an interview published Wednesday. "We do not think sanctions will work, but we understand that it is impossible to get by without them in certain circumstances," Sergei Ryabkov was quoted as saying by the business daily Kommersant. (Russia-Iran-Sanction) PYONGYANG -- Foreign Minister Pak Ui Chun of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) met here Wednesday with a visiting special envoy of U.N. Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon, the official news agency KCNA reported. (DPRK-UN) ISLAMABAD -- At least 15 people, including 12 paramilitary troops, were killed and eight others wounded in a suicide attack on military convoy in northwest Pakistan's tribal area Wednesday, officials and witnesses said. The bomber on foot approached the vehicle of security personnel in Khyber Agency who were on routine patrolling, witnesses said. (Pakistan-Suicide Attack- Casualties) ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan's Minister of Interior Rehman Malik said Wednesday that Pakistani Taliban chief Hakeemullah Mehsud was dead. It is the first time Pakistani authorities made clear the militant chief is dead. Talking to media in Peshawar, capital of North West Frontier Province, Malik also denied Taliban claims about talks with the Pakistani government. "No talks with Taliban until they surrender arms," he said. (Pakistan-Taliban) TEHRAN -- A senior Iranian atomic official said Wednesday that the enrichment process of 20-percent uranium fuel which started on Tuesday moves forward "well," the official IRNA news agency reported. The enrichment process of 20-percent uranium fuel is "continuous", said Head of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) Ali Akbar Salehi, adding that, "The process is moving forward well and the president will talk more about it tomorrow." (Iran-Uranium Enrichment)A state of emergency was declared for the Island of Aitutaki in the Cook Islands on Thursday. The island took a battering from Cyclone Pat on Thursday morning and up to 90 percent of houses have damage to their roofs, Radio New Zealand International reported. The cyclone is about 25 nautical miles south-west of Aitutaki and about 120 nautical miles north of the main island, Rarotonga. The Disaster Management Office in Rarotonga said the cyclone has caused serious damage to Aitutaki and Prime Minister Jim Marurai has declared a state of emergency. Inspector Tere Pati said the path of the cyclone is now slightly off Aitutaki and it is possible the cyclone could hit Rarotonga on Thursday night. "A lot of houses have been damaged, trees were uprooted, and the road has been blocked by fallen trees and debris, no power to the island, the communication is down, but they trying at the moment to get the communication back on," the radio quoted him as saying. He said no deaths have been reported but injuries are likely, though it's difficult to assess the situation because of the lack of communication. The Cook Islands Police Commissioner, Maara Tetava says tourist resorts in Aitutaki appear to have weathered the storm and the airport seems to be intact. He said the island's population of about 2000 people, are hunkering down as Cyclone Pat passes. Schools and government departments on the main island of Rarotonga was closed on Thursday.British actor Ian Carmichael, one of the stars of "I'm All Right Jack" and other comedies, has died at age 89. His family says Carmichael died at his home in northern England on Friday after falling ill at the end of last year. Carmichael was a master at embodying a certain type of Englishman: diffident, awkward, often put-upon but unfailingly courteous and well-intentioned. He appeared in a series of comedies for the Boulting Brothers including "Private's Progress," "Brothers in Law," "Lucky Jim" and "I'm All Right Jack." Later in his career he played the upper-class twit Bertie Wooster, and Dorothy L. Sayers suave detective Lord Peter Wimsey, in television series.Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas will travel to France next week to discuss with President Nicolas Sarkozy efforts to resurrect the Middle East peace process, officials said on Tuesday. Abbas is due to meet with French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner in Paris on February 21 and with Sarkozy the following day, a senior Palestinian official said on condition of anonymity. The Palestinian president has agreed in principle to a US proposal that he hold indirect talks with Israel under Washington's mediation, but has requested a number of guarantees. The US has been trying in vain for months to get Israel and Palestinians to relaunch negotiations that were suspended during the Gaza war in December 2008-January 2009.President Barack Obama has called Ukraine's pro-Russian opposition leader Viktor Yanukovych to congratulate him on winning the country's presidential election. But Obama's call Thursday comes as Ukraine's embattled Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko ignores calls to concede defeat in the election and resign her post. The final preliminary vote count in Sunday's election indicates Yanukovych defeated Tymoshenko by a margin of 3.5 percentage points. The White House says that Obama wished Yanukovych success and commended the Ukrainian people on the conduct of the vote.Russian officials reacted coolly on Friday to the news that Romania had agreed to host U.S. missile interceptors starting in 2015, with a top envoy saying that the announcement could directly affect Moscow's position as negotiations to replace the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START, reach their conclusion. Dmitri O. Rogozin, Russia's permanent representative to NATO, said the United States had not fulfilled its promise to consult Russia on developments in the missile defense system. He suggested that the interceptors could pose a threat to Russia's security, while noting that both Romanian and U.S. officials went out of their way to assure Moscow otherwise. "It seems to be in line with Freud's theory -- it means they have some thoughts that the system could be targeted against Russia, otherwise why would they dissuade us about something we never asked about?" he said. Though the general outlines of the new missile defense plan -- including the staging of land-based interceptors in Europe -- were made public months ago, Russian officials made it clear that they were taken aback by the announcement of Romania's role. Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov said the Russian and American presidents had agreed that the "threats and risks of missile proliferation will be assessed jointly as a first step." "We expect our American partners to provide exhaustive explanations on those issues in the context of this dialog," the Interfax news service quoted Lavrov as saying at a news conference in Germany, where he traveled to attend the Munich Security Conference. The announcement came at a sensitive moment. At the Munich conference, Lavrov has meetings planned with Iran's foreign minister, and he has suggested that Russia may be ready to consider sanctions against Iran if he is not satisfied with the response in their discussion about Tehran's nuclear program. And with the START renegotiation, a central project in the "reset" between the countries, in its final stages, Russian leaders have repeatedly said missile defense remains a stumbling block. Russian analysts said the SM-3 interceptors planned for Romania posed no threat to Russia's nuclear deterrent, since they target medium- and short-range missiles. But that might change when a second generation of interceptors is put in place in 2018, a possibility that makes Moscow wary, because the United States is under no obligation to share data about the system, said Sergei M. Rogov, director of the Institute for the U.S. and Canada Studies in Moscow. "Here comes the question of transparency," he said. "Why is the U.S. making a decision again without consulting with Russia?" The announcement is not likely to derail START negotiations, Rogov said, but could jeopardize talks that negotiators hoped would follow, including deeper cuts to strategic nuclear weapons. The news from Romania came, he said, amid various signs of "reverse movement" in the "reset": START negotiations have dragged on, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton rejected Russian calls for a new European security structure, and Poland and Sweden called for Russia to withdraw its nuclear missiles from Kaliningrad. "Additional issues are overloading the 'reset,' which is not moving very far or very fast," Rogov said. "So I am concerned about it." Those concerns were underlined when Russia released its new military doctrine, approved on Friday by President Dmitri Medvedev. The document, which guides military policy for a decade, identified the U.S. missile defense system as a major threat to Russian security, saying it "undermines global stability and violates the current balance of nuclear forces." Another central concern of the document was the continued expansion of NATO and the organization's attempt "to globalize its functions in violation of international law."Following are the results from the ATP SAP Open first round on Tuesday (prefix number denotes seeding): Ricardas Berankis, Lithuania, bt Robby Ginepri, United States, 6-7(5), 6-2, 6-3 Bjorn Phau, Germany, bt 8-Jeremy Chardy, France, 6-3, 6-1 Benjamin Becker, Germany, bt Tim Smyczek, United States, 6-4, 6-2Rep. John Murtha, a retired Marine Corps officer who became the first Vietnam War combat veteran elected to Congress and later an outspoken and influential critic of the Iraq War, died Monday. He was 77. The Pennsylvania Democrat had been suffering complications from gallbladder surgery. He died at the Virginia Hospital Center, spokesman Matthew Mazonkey said. Murtha was an officer in the Marine Reserves when he was elected in 1974. Ethical questions often shadowed his congressional service, but he was best known for being among Congress' most hawkish Democrats. He wielded considerable clout for two decades as the ranking Democrat on the House subcommittee that oversees Pentagon spending. Murtha voted in 2002 to authorize President George W. Bush to use military force in Iraq, but his growing frustration over the administration's handling of the war prompted him in November 2005 to call for an immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops. "The war in Iraq is not going as advertised. It is a flawed policy wrapped in illusion," he said. Murtha's opposition to the Iraq war rattled Washington, where the tall, gruff-mannered congressman enjoyed bipartisan respect for his work on military issues. On Capitol Hill, Murtha was seen as speaking for those in uniform when it came to military matters. William Russell, Murtha's Republican opponent in the 2008 election, who was planning to challenge him again in November, asked in a statement Monday that people pray for the Murtha family and said his campaign would suspend activity for a few days. "Regardless of your political position, you always knew Jack had an immense love and loyalty to his family and the residents of the 12th Congressional District," Russell said. Gov. Ed Rendell said Monday that he has not decided when to schedule a special election to replace Murtha. He has 10 days by law; the political parties must come up with their own candidates. The governor said that it would save taxpayer money to hold the election on May 18, the state's planned primary date, but that he might set it sooner in the event of urgent congressional issues. Unlike the Senate where the Democrats recent loss of a single seat greatly complicated efforts to pass key leglislation, the Democrats hold a healthy majority 256-178 in the house. Born June 17, 1932, John Patrick Murtha delivered newspapers and worked at a gas station before graduating High School. Military service was in Murtha's blood. He said his great-grandfather served in the Civil War, his father and three uncles in World War II, and his brothers in the Marine Corps. He left Washington and Jefferson College in 1952 to join the Marines, where he rose through the ranks to become a drill instructor at Parris Island, South Carolina, and later served in the 2nd Marine Division. Murtha moved back to Johnstown and remained with the Marine Reserves until he volunteered to go to Vietnam. He served as an intelligence officer there from 1966 to 1967 and recieved several military honors. After his discharge from the Marines, Murtha ran a small business in Johnstown. He went to the University of Pittsburgh, graduating in 1962 with a degree in economics. He served in the Pennsylvania House in Harrisburg from 1969 until he was elected to Congress in a special election in 1974. In 1990, he retired from the Marine Reserves as a colonel. "Ever since I was a young boy, I had two goals in life -- I wanted to be a colonel in the Marine Corps and a member of Congress," Murtha wrote in his 2004 book, "From Vietnam to 9/11," referring to the Sept. 11 attacks. Murtha's criticism of the Iraq war intensified in 2006, when he accused Marines of murdering Iraqi civilians "in cold blood" at Haditha, Iraq, after one Marine died and two were wounded by a roadside bomb. Critics said Murtha unfairly held the Marines responsible before an investigation was concluded and fueled enemy retaliation. He said that the war couldn't be won militarily and that such incidents dimmed the prospect for a political solution. "This is the kind of war you have to win the hearts and minds of the people," Murtha said. "And we're set back every time something like this happens." In 2008, the Republican Party used Murtha's words against him in TV ads aired less than a month before the election. The ads cited his criticism of the Haditha incident, as well as his comment about "racist" voting tendencies of many western Pennsylvania residents. Still, Murtha handily won his 18th full term.Tony Blair's former communications chief gave an emotional defence of the ex- prime minister Sunday, saying he had been subject to "vilification" over Britain's war with Iraq but was an "honourable man". A week after Blair gave evidence to the public inquiry into the conflict, in which he declared no regrets about removing Saddam Hussein, Alastair Campbell hit out at critics of his former boss in a BBC television interview. He rejected long-standing allegations that Blair misled parliament when he claimed the Iraqi leader had weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and accused the media of "settling your scores" in their coverage of the issue. Campbell become emotional and had to pause to compose himself at one point, saying: "I'm sorry if I do get upset about this but I was there alongside Tony, I know how that decision weighed on him, I know the care that we took." Blair's appearance on January 29 was the highlight of the ongoing inquiry into the war, which remains highly divisive here despite Britain's formal withdrawal from Iraq in July. His remark at the hearing that he had no regrets in removing Saddam, even though no WMD were found, sparked outrage among relatives of the 179 British soldiers who died in the conflict, as well as in many sections of the media. One of Blair's former ministers, Clare Short, who resigned over the war, also put the knife in when she appeared before the inquiry on Tuesday. She rejected Blair's assertion that Iraq was better off without Saddam and accused him of having been "frantic" to support then US president George W. Bush in taking military action. The issue is likely to be damaging for Blair's Labour party and the man who took over from him as prime minister, Gordon Brown, ahead of a general election which must be held by June. Brown was finance minister during the invasion and is due make his inquiry appearance before the vote, which Labour is widely tipped to lose. The Iraq war dogged the second half of Blair's time in office and contributed to his decision to resign in 2007, but he has consistently rejected criticism of his motives over the past seven years. Questioned about why Blair said it was "beyond doubt" that Iraq had WMD when the intelligence was patchy at best, Campbell was equally defiant, saying: "The prime minister did not mislead parliament." Pressed further, however, he paused and became emotional. "I've been through a lot on this," he said. Composing himself, he continued: "Tony Blair, I think, is a totally honourable man. "And I also think that what we've taken on this... this constant vilification... I think the way that this whole issue has developed now is, I don't think people are interested in the truth. "I think you're all (in the media) interested in settling your scores and setting your own agenda." Campbell acknowledged people were still deeply upset about the war. But, he added: "The reason people are going over it again and again and again and again is because those who do disagree with the judgment that Tony Blair made actually don't even want to see the other side of the story."Robert Guerrero has vacated his International Boxing Federation super featherweight title to be with his wife, Casey, as she battles Leukemia. Guerrero announced his decision Tuesday, a week after he was forced to drop out of a proposed bout with Michael Katsidis. Casey Guerrero is in hospital as she recovers from a bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy. Guerrero, who owns a record of 25-1-1 with 17 knockouts, won a featherweight title before his wife was diagnosed with the disease in 2007. He vacated that title in 2008 to move up to super featherweight, and claimed the IBF title last August with a 12-round unanimous decision over South African Malcolm Klassen in Houston. The Guerreros, whose hometown is just south of the San Francisco Bay Area, have two small children.National coach Joachim Loew ended his stand-off with the German Football Federation (DFB) on Tuesday as both parties agreed to plough all their efforts into Germany's 2010 World Cup campaign. "We have agreed upon a clear strategy right up to the World Cup," Loew said during a televised press conference from the DFB's base in Frankfurt. "We agree that our mutual interest is tied to the build-up to the World Cup over the coming weeks and months and we will prepare the team so that it can enjoy a good tournament." Loew confirmed that an extension to his contract, which expires in July this year, will not be discussed until after the World Cup. The DFB suspended negotiations over a two-year extension to Loew's contract, citing wage demands made by Loew and the team's general manager Oliver Bierhoff. Loew had been expected to agree to stay on until the 2012 European Championship and on Sunday he declared himself "very angry" with the DFB's decision to publicise details of their negotiations. Bayern Munich president Karl-Heinz Rummenigge had earlier urged the DFB to find a solution with Loew. The Bayern chief also criticised Bierhoff for having reportedly demanded the right to veto the appointment of Loew's successor. "That was not acceptable (but) I think he's prepared to take a step back," said Rummenigge, who added that the DFB had made a "serious mistake -- the biggest mistake possible -- by publicising the contents of the contract". Loew took over as Germany's national coach in 2006 after two years as an assistant to Jurgen Klinsmann. Under Loew's guidance, in 45 games Germany have recorded 31 victories, eight draws and six defeats. At this summer's World Cup, Germany have been drawn in Group D with Australia, Ghana and Serbia.Defending champion Tom Boonen of Quick Step has won the fifth stage at the Tour of Qatar, while Dutch cyclist Wouter Mol of the Vacansoleil Pro Cycling Team retained the overall lead. Boonen won the 142 kilometer stage in a time of 3 hours, 13 minutes on Thursday. The Belgian, a three-time winner in Qatar, finished ahead of Danilo Napolitano of Italy and Edvald Boasson Hagen of Norway. Mol, the overnight leader, has an overall time of 13:12:28 after five stages. Steurs Geert of Belgium is nine seconds back in second, while Boonen is a minute and 45 seconds behind the leader.Roberto Mancini paid tribute to two players at either ends of their careers after Manchester City boosted their bid for a fourth-place finish in the Premier League with a 2-0 victory over Bolton. Carlos Tevez, from the penalty spot, and Emmanuel Adebayor scored the goals that secured the three points at Eastlands on Tuesday, but City also enjoyed terrific performances from two full debutants. England under-21 winger Adam Johnson, 22, proved unstoppable for long spells of the game and won the penalty from which Tevez gave City the lead. Meanwhile, alongside him in midfield, France international Patrick Vieira also made his full debut for the wealthy club and turned in an impressive display including a superb pass that set up the second goal. "He played very well, that's why I bought him," said Mancini of Johnson, signed from Middlesbrough during the January transfer window. "When you're a young player you want to play well and have a chance and that's why this game was important for him. He did well for the penalty and went on from there. "He can learn to play behind the striker, on the right wing, on the left wing, he can play in different positions, different situations and be an important player for us. "I am happy for Patrick because that was his first full game in one month and he came through without a problem. I know Patrick well and I know he can play better but for now, it was just important he came through alright. "People talk about his age but I played until I was 36 and I played very well! When I was 36, I won the Scudetto and the Italian Cup. I hope Patrick can play the next 15 games for me." Victory keeps City slightly ahead of three other clubs chasing fourth place, and the coveted final spot in next season's Champions League, if only by virtue of having games in hand on their rivals. Like City, Liverpool, Aston Villa and Tottenham have all failed to hit real consistency and Mancini concedes that once this weekend's FA Cup commitments are out of the way, his team must focus on stringing together a good run of league results, particularly away from Eastlands. "It is important that we are now in fourth position," said Mancini. "We have a big game in hand at Stoke next Tuesday and we must win that game if we want to finish fourth. We are in a good position now, and have games in hand, but we must keep improving." The concerns of Bolton manager Owen Coyle are centred firmly on the other end of the table with his team having won just one of their six games since he took command. "I'm delighted with the performance but disappointed we didn't get any points," said Coyle. "We have come to a club that cost 300 million pounds to build, we were away from home, and for a long duration of the match we made them look very ordinary. "From the games we have had, two against Arsenal, away at Liverpool, away at Man City, we recognized that any points we could pick up from those games would be a bonus. "Now, after the cup tie on Saturday, we have six games against teams around us and if we collect points from those I am confident we will be fine."Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko of Ukraine effectively conceded the presidential election on Saturday by withdrawing her legal challenge, saying that she did not believe that she would get a fair hearing. Her decision clears the way for the inauguration on Thursday of the winner, Viktor F. Yanukovich, the opposition leader, capping a comeback for him. Yanukovich was humiliated in the 2004 Orange Revolution, when he was criticized as a Kremlin pawn who did not want Ukraine to become more democratic and pro-Western. Yanukovich has sought to refashion his image in recent years, vowing to improve relations with both the European Union and Russia. Speaking Saturday at the court in Kiev that was hearing her appeal, Tymoshenko was defiant, and her party said it would boycott Yanukovich's inauguration. "Sooner or later, an honest prosecutor's office and an honest court will assess that Yanukovich was not elected president of Ukraine, and that the will of the people was fabricated," she said. The end of her challenge is expected to bring about a relatively peaceful transfer of power in Ukraine, a little more than five years after the mass protests known as the Orange Revolution broke out over a disputed presidential election in 2004. Still, Tymoshenko, an Orange leader, remains prime minister, and has rejected Yanukovich's demand that she resign. He intends to put together a coalition in parliament to dismiss her or, if that fails, to call parliamentary elections, which could create more political instability. Yanukovich's aides say he now has to try to unite the country by reaching out to Orange voters, who are concentrated in the Ukrainian-speaking western part of the country and tend to view him as a Soviet-style party boss. Yanukovich is from the east, where Russian is the primary language. At the same time, Yanukovich also wants to mend ties with the Kremlin. On Saturday, after Tymoshenko abandoned her challenge, President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia called Yanukovich, and the two men agreed that Yanukovich would visit Moscow in early March, the Kremlin said.Former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson predicted the U.S. government will regain every penny given to the banks during the economic meltdown -- and may even profit. Billionaire Warren Buffett agreed with Paulson Tuesday that the bank bailout will eventually be profitable for the nation. The two men spoke at the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce's annual meeting. Buffett led the talk by asking Paulson about his recently released book: "On the Brink: Inside the Race to Stop the Collapse of the Global Financial System." Buffett, the longtime Democrat, said Paulson's book gave him an appreciation of how well former President George W. Bush understood the economy and how the government reacted during crisis.Michael Ballack has hit back at Arsene Wenger's sniping at Chelsea's perceived lack of flair by accusing the Arsenal manager of sour grapes over his side's faltering Premier League title challenge. Arsenal enjoyed plenty of possession when the two clubs met at Stamford Bridge but it was Chelsea who ran out 2-0 winners with Wenger complaining post-match that "we didn't get a demonstration of football". Ballack's response was to point out that Arsenal's pretty football was not achieving the results they would like. "We knew the way Arsenal play," the Germany captain said. "It is always the same style. If you play tactics like we did, you can beat them. "This season and the season before they showed they weren't able to win the league. "He (Wenger) always says things like this when he loses to find an excuse - but football is not possession of the ball and playing a nice pass, football is about winning games and that is what Manchester United showed when they played them and what we did. "Football is a mixture of winning games and good football physically, but also technically. We have a good mix in the team as we have shown this season and you can't do more. We are in first position and that counts."Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko may in the next days recognise the validity of presidential elections won by her rival Viktor Yanukovych, a deputy in her party said on Wednesday. "I think that in the next days, perhaps today, perhaps tomorrow, Yulia Tymoshenko will make her announcement," said Sviatoslav Olyinyk, a deputy wth her Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko (BYuT). "I can predict it will be an announcement acknowledging the legitimacy of the election results and her move to the opposition," he said according to the Interfax-Ukraine news agency. Tymoshenko has so far made no announcement conceding defeat to Yanukovych and her party has alleged widespread violations in Sunday's vote.Ruling party candidate Laura Chinchilla declared victory on Sunday night in Costa Rica's presidential election with most of the vote counted. Chinchilla won 46.8 percent of the vote from 67.9 percent of the votes counted by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. Under the country's constitution, a candidate is required to gain at least 40 percent of the popular votes to win outright. Chinchilla's two main rivals Otton Solis of the Citizen Action Party (PAC) and Otto Guevara of the Libertarian Movement Party (ML), have conceded defeat and congratulated her on being elected the country's first female president. "With a lot of respect, we accept the reality," said Solis, who was just 1 percent of votes away from a victory in 2006 elections. Chinchilla, the 50-year-old vice president for incumbent President Oscar Arias, told the public that she, as the next president of the country, would keep what she had promised during the campaign. "We don't receive a bounced cheque from the people. To the contrary, we have shouldered solemn obligations to hold dialogues with all parties and social sectors," she said. Chinchilla's campaign platform included improvement of the country's infrastructure, creation of a progressive income tax and new jobs with "green jobs" initiative. She also has promised to create more job opportunities, better living conditions for children and senior citizens, as well as to combat crimes and drug trafficking. Chinchilla, a graduate of Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., started her professional career as a consultant. She became the first female minister of public security from 1996 to 1998. Chinchilla joined the Legislative Assembly in 2002 and was tapped to be first vice president for incumbent President Oscar Arias in 2006. Chinchilla was expected to continue the policies of promoting free trade and international business ties carried out by President Arias. Earlier, oppositions criticized her for acting like Arias' puppet. The presidential voting was part of the general elections in Costa Rica which took place from 6 a.m. local time (1200 GMT) to 6 p.m. (2400 GMT). Some 2.8 million Costa Ricans have registered to choose a new president who will serve a four-year term, two vice presidents, 57 parliamentarians and 495 local deputies. However, nearly 32.3 percent of the registered voters did not go to the polls. Costa Rica is the only Latin American country which in 60 years has enjoyed democratic elections without interruption, said Emma Maria Mejia, chief of an observer mission from the Organization of American States (OAS).Chadian President Idriss Deby Itno paid a "historic" visit Monday to Khartoum, in a bid to seal a thaw in ties and boost efforts to bring peace to Sudan's war- torn Darfur region. Sudanese President Omar al-Beshir greeted Deby at Khartoum airport on the start of a visit expected to help seal last month's accord normalising ties which are essential to peace in Darfur. "This is a historic visit," Sudan's Foreign Minister Deng Alor told reporters at the airport. "I think it is going to promote relations between the two countries. We have been trying to improve relations between Chad and Sudan. I think this visit is a testimony to what we have been doing and we hope to see a lot of issues being discussed and resolved," he added. Chad has long accused Sudan of supporting rebels seeking to oust the government, while Khartoum has charged Ndjamena with backing ethnic minority rebels in the western region of Darfur. But the two neighbours also agreed in mid-January to deploy a joint force on their border, in a move aimed at ending the presence of rebels on each other's territory and stemming their activity, as part of normalisation efforts. Chad and Sudan had in the past signed similar agreements but these accords were never implemented. "This time it seems serious. They both need it right now," a diplomat told AFP last month on condition of anonymity. "Chad is heading towards legislative elections in November and presidential elections in April 2011, while elections in Sudan are scheduled for April and a referendum (on southern independence) in January 2011," the diplomat said. Announcing plans to visit Khartoum last week, Deby said: "I am a man of dialogue and openess. War has never settled things... Chad wants to live in perfect harmony with all its neighbours." Improved ties between the two countries is seen as a major step towards peace in Darfur, where the United Nations says about 300,000 people have died since ethnic rebels revolted in 2003. Khartoum says 10,000 were killed. The two countries broke off diplomatic relations for several months in 2008 after a surprise rebel attack on Ndjamena which came close to overthrowing Deby before government forces rallied to rout the insurgents. Sudan in July complained to the UN Security Council after Chad launched air raids on its territory a few days after another failed rebel offensive on the capital. Chad later admitted it had bombarded rebel rear bases in Darfur. Deby took power in a military coup in 1990 with Sudan's backing, but has since been democratically elected, and eastern Chad currently hosts thousands of Sudanese refugees who fled the civil war in Darfur. Legal teams from both countries were due to meet also on Monday in Ndjamena to carve out the joint force's rules of engagement, while Sudan is expected to lead the first Chadian-Sudanese border unit. A Sudanese diplomat has said the force should be made up of 3,000 men, with Sudan and Chad each providing 1,500. The Sudanese foreign minister also expressed hope Deby's visit would contribute to progress in indirect talks under way in the Qatari capital, Doha, between the Khartoum government and Darfur rebels. "This visit is going definitely to have a positive impact on the Doha talks," he said.Results from the first day of the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament here on Monday (x denotes seeding): 1st rd: Florian Mayer (GER) bt Janko Tipsarevic (SRB) 6-3, 6-7 (6/8), 7-6 (8/6) Robin Soderling (SWE x3) bt Florent Serra (FRA) 4-6, 6-4, 6-1 Andreas Seppi (ITA) bt Stephane Bohli (SUI) 6-1, 7-5A woman who befriended a Florida lottery winner who later went missing was charged Tuesday as an accessory after the fact in his slaying, five days after his body was found buried in her backyard. Dorice "DeeDee" Moore, 37, was charged as an accessory after the fact to first-degree murder in the slaying of Abraham Shakespeare, Hillsborough County Sheriff David Gee said. Moore has denied hurting Shakespeare, 43. No one else has been arrested. Moore's arrest is another twist in the monthslong and bizarre case. Shakespeare was last seen in April, and officials in Polk County -- where he lived and was reported missing -- have long thought he was slain. Investigators had announced earlier Tuesday that an autopsy showed the Lakeland resident died of "homicidal violence" but would not give specifics. In January, Polk officials named Moore a "person of interest" in Shakespeare's disappearance. She befriended him after he claimed the $30 million winning ticket in 2006 and took a $17 million lump sum payment. Moore said she wanted to write a book about Shakespeare, but officials said she actually scammed him out of money. Property records show she bought a $1 million home from Shakespeare for $655,000 and she acknowledged moving $2 million of his money into her bank account. In an interview Monday with The Tampa Tribune, Moore said she anticipated being arrested. Shakespeare's body was found Thursday buried 5 feet (1.5 meters) deep under a 30-by-30 foot (9-by-9meter) concrete slab behind the home Moore owns with her boyfriend. Moore told the paper that she ordered it poured for use as a boat and camper skirt. However, Moore said she never hurt Shakespeare. "I would never take another human's life. No amount of money in the world is worth that," she said. Family members say Shakespeare, a truck driver's assistant, was barely literate, and people constantly hounded him for a piece of his winnings. Last week, Shakespeare's brother told The Associated Press that Shakespeare often wished he had never bought the winning ticket. "'I'd have been better off broke.' He said that to me all the time," Robert Brown said. Moore was being held at the Hillsborough County Jail. Her attorney, John Liguori, did not immediately return a call seeking comment.Bolton defender Gary Cahill's chances of going to the World Cup with England have been destroyed by a blood clot in his arm which is likely to mean he misses the rest of the season. Cahill, 24, missed his club's goalless draw with Fulham on Saturday after his arm swelled up on the morning of the match. "There was no way he could play so we took him straight off to hospital," Bolton manager Owen Coyle reported. "It turns out he had a blood clot in his arm, so he is going to be out for a number of months." Cahill was due to be released from hospital on Monday but the treatment for his condition will prevent him playing for the forseeable future. "It is a severe blow for the boy but our main concern is his welfare," Coyle added. "We have to make sure Gary is fit and well. "He will miss the next few months, it might be for the rest of the season, we will hear from the specialist later. "The clot needed to be resolved and in doing that you need the medication. It follows you can't play. "As disappointed as we are, at 24, Gary has a marvellous career ahead of him. I believe he would have made the World Cup for the summer but we have to make sure first of all he recovers from this blood clot." Cahill broke into Fabio Capello's England squad last year and had been widely tipped to make the squad for South Africa given the injury doubts covering a number of the defenders who are above him in the international pecking order. Even if he could make it back in time for the end of the season, it is hard to see him meeting Capello's criteria for inclusion in his final squad, which are that players are playing regularly for their clubs and are fully match fit. The loss of Cahill is also a severe blow to Bolton, who are battling for survival in the Premier League. Coyle's side travel to Manchester City on Tuesday with just one point keeping them out of the relegation zone.A luxury car belonging to actor Charlie Sheen was found crashed in a Los Angeles ravine early Friday after having been reported as stolen by the troubled star, police said. A team of firefighters found the wreckage of Sheen's Mercedes nestling 100 feet down a hillside on Mulholland Drive. No victim or passengers were discovered in the car, authorities said. The search was launched after a cell phone caller told the California Highway Patrol early Friday that a black vehicle had gone over the side of the road, CHP Officer Patrick Kimball said. Sheen reported his car stolen, Los Angeles Police Department Officer Bruce Borihanh said. "It is being investigated as an auto theft," Borihanh said. Los Angeles police Chief Charlie Beck told KTLA television he "had no reason to disbelieve" Sheen's report of the car being stolen. The incident comes as Sheen faces a court hearing in Aspen, Colorado on Monday in connection with a domestic violence incident in December. Sheen, the star of Oscar-winning films such as "Platoon" and "Wall Street," is alleged to have attacked his wife of 19 months, Brooke Mueller, at a vacation home in Aspen on Christmas Day. The 44-year-old, who also stars in the primetime television comedy series "Two And A Half Men," is expected to be charged with felony menacing and misdemeanor assault in connection with the incident. Mueller, who was unhurt in the incident, has since indicated she does not want her husband to be prosecuted and is set to appear in court on Monday according to reports. After several entanglements with the law in the 1990s in cases related to drugs, domestic violence and prostitution, Sheen is now one of the best-paid TV comedians thanks to "Two and a Half Men" and "Spin City."Laura Chinchilla was on course to become Costa Rica's first female president and only the fifth ever in Latin America, preliminary results from the election commission indicated Sunday. Chinchilla, the ruling party candidate, won 47.6 percent of the first 20.1 percent of votes counted, more than 20 percentage points ahead of her main opponents, and above the 40 percent needed to avoid a run-off. Center-left opposition candidate Otton Solis won 23.15 percent of the votes counted, in second place, and right-wing lawyer Otto Guevara garnered 21.85 percent. Solis, who lost by a whisker to current President Oscar Arias in 2006, already accepted defeat at that point. "With a lot of respect, we accept the reality," Solis told a gathering of his followers. The opposition had criticized Chinchilla as being a puppet of Arias, and she was expected to continue his policies of promoting free trade and international business ties. The 50-year-old served as vice president under Arias and is socially conservative on issues such as abortion. Her National Liberation Party (PLN) bet on her past experience as public security minister and justice minister to win voters over on the issue of crime issue, a key concern for voters. Balloting took place calmly throughout Latin America's oldest democracy, which has no army, amid fears of high abstention rates. Abstention was at 33.43 percent, according to initial results, of some 2.8 million eligible to vote for a new president, two vice presidents, as well as 57 lawmakers and municipal leaders. The elections again tested the organizational skills of the PLN, which has dominated politics in Costa Rica for the past six decades, despite the emergence of new parties in recent years. Solis, an economist from the Citizen's Action Party, the biggest opposition grouping, had lagged behind Guevara in pre-election surveys. Guevara, a 49-year-old lawyer who founded the pro-business Libertarian Movement Party, had proposed changing the currency to the dollar, and more free trade deals for the country currently negotiating a deal with China, after switching allegiance from Taiwan in 2007. He also called for change to end corruption, following several scandals in recent years. Former president Rafael Angel Calderon pulled out of the campaign after receiving a five-year prison sentence for corruption. Some 200 international observers oversaw the elections, and children helped thousands of volunteers aiding the process, which Arias called "a multi-colored party." He is due to hand over to the new president on May 8.Following are the first-round results from the PTT Pattaya Women's Open in Pattaya, Thailand on Monday (prefix number denotes seeding): 2-Sabine Lisicki, Germany, bt Akgul Amanmuradova, Uzbekistan, 6-0, retired Chanelle Scheepers, South Africa, bt Noppawan Lertcheewakarn, Thailand, 6-7 (9/11), 6-4, 6-4 Anna Chakvetadze, Russia, bt Jill Craybas, United States, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3Andrew Strauss is taking a break from the pressures of the England cricket team captaincy in an isolated village in the state of Victoria, Australian media have reported. Strauss has been criticised for showing a lack of respect for Test cricket following his decision to opt out of this month's tour of Bangladesh, saying he wants to be fresh for England's Ashes tour to Australia later this year. The England opening batsman has been spotted in the township of Buninyong, near Ballarat, west of Melbourne, according to The Age newspaper. The newspaper said members of the Buninyong Cricket Club have been sworn to secrecy over his whereabouts. "Andrew was quite adamant that he didn't want them to tell anyone he was in town," a local source told The Age on Thursday. The newspaper said the cricketer's cover was blown when a "well-spoken Englishman bearing a striking resemblance to the England captain" was spotted at the cricket club's fundraising night last week. Buninyong Cricket Club said Strauss had stayed briefly to speak to its junior cricketers and sign autographs but they were unsure whether he was still in town, The Age said. Strauss and his Australian wife, Ruth, who grew up in Ballarat, have bought a house in the area in recent years and he was enjoying some peace and quiet with in-laws, it said. Ballarat councillor Ben Taylor said Buninyong, population 1,800, was the perfect place to escape the spotlight of international cricket. "Even if they knew he was there they wouldn't tell anyone," he said. "The good thing is it's more of a village atmosphere so he could go there and not be interfered with." Strauss' decision to skip the two-Test, three ODI tour of Bangladesh has been criticised by Australian Test great Shane Warne. "It's disappointing that the captain of England decides to have a rest from a Test series. I can't comprehend that," Warne said earlier this month. "Any time you represent your country it's special and I cannot understand how you can rest your captain."Roberto Mancini paid tribute to two players at either ends of their careers after Manchester City boosted their bid for a fourth-place finish in the Premier League with a 2-0 victory over Bolton. Carlos Tevez, from the penalty spot, and Emmanuel Adebayor scored the goals that secured the three points at Eastlands on Tuesday, but City also enjoyed terrific performances from two full debutants. England under-21 winger Adam Johnson, 22, proved unstoppable for long spells of the game and won the penalty from which Tevez gave City the lead. Meanwhile, alongside him in midfield, France international Patrick Vieira also made his full debut for the wealthy club and turned in an impressive display including a superb pass that set up the second goal. "He played very well, that's why I bought him," said Mancini of Johnson, signed from Middlesbrough during the January transfer window. "When you're a young player you want to play well and have a chance and that's why this game was important for him. He did well for the penalty and went on from there. "He can learn to play behind the striker, on the right wing, on the left wing, he can play in different positions, different situations and be an important player for us. "I am happy for Patrick because that was his first full game in one month and he came through without a problem. I know Patrick well and I know he can play better but for now, it was just important he came through alright. "People talk about his age but I played until I was 36 and I played very well! When I was 36, I won the Scudetto and the Italian Cup. I hope Patrick can play the next 15 games for me." Victory keeps City slightly ahead of three other clubs chasing fourth place, and the coveted final spot in next season's Champions League, if only by virtue of having games in hand on their rivals. Like City, Liverpool, Aston Villa and Tottenham have all failed to hit real consistency and Mancini concedes that once this weekend's FA Cup commitments are out of the way, his team must focus on stringing together a good run of league results, particularly away from Eastlands. "It is important that we are now in fourth position," said Mancini. "We have a big game in hand at Stoke next Tuesday and we must win that game if we want to finish fourth. We are in a good position now, and have games in hand, but we must keep improving." The concerns of Bolton manager Owen Coyle are centred firmly on the other end of the table with his team having won just one of their six games since he took command. "I'm delighted with the performance but disappointed we didn't get any points," said Coyle. "We have come to a club that cost 300 million pounds to build, we were away from home, and for a long duration of the match we made them look very ordinary. "From the games we have had, two against Arsenal, away at Liverpool, away at Man City, we recognized that any points we could pick up from those games would be a bonus. "Now, after the cup tie on Saturday, we have six games against teams around us and if we collect points from those I am confident we will be fine."Ukraine Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko faced pressure Monday to concede defeat to her triumphant rival Viktor Yanukovich in presidential polls as she maintained an uncharacteristic silence on the result. In an implicit call on Tymoshenko to concede, international observers including the OSCE said that it was time for the country's leaders to "listen to the verdict". The EU meanwhile said it was ready to work with Yanukovich. Foes and supporters of the prime minister have both keenly awaited her first comments on the results. Last week, she had vowed to call mass protests if she detected any fraud by her rival. Aides twice announced and then cancelled press conferences at government headquarters, saying later that she would now only speak to reporters on Tuesday. Such taciturnity is highly unusual for Tymoshenko, known for her glamorous image topped by a golden hair braid and as someone who normally never shies away from publicity. International observers have given the elections a relatively clean bill of health. Results with almost all the votes counted give Yanukovich a lead of just over three percent. "It is now time for the countrys political leaders to listen to the peoples verdict and make sure that the transition of power is peaceful and constructive," said Joao Soares, special coordinator of the OSCE short-term observers. "Yesterdays vote was an impressive display of democratic elections. For everyone in Ukraine, this election was a victory," he added. The observers in a joint statement praised the "professional, transparent and honest voting and counting" in Sunday's polls. Meanwhile EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton praised the "calm atmosphere" of the vote and said Europe was ready to work with Yanukovich. "The European Union remains committed to deepening the relationship with Ukraine and supporting it in implementing its reform agenda. It looks forward to working with the new president to this end," Ashton said in a statement. After the publication of Sunday's exit polls, Tymoshenko had said the election was not over until the last vote was counted and has not made any further comment or public appearance since. Yanukovich declared victory on Sunday and said it was time for the prime minister to step down as he wanted someone he found more suitable. By contrast to the silence of Tymoshenko's Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko (BYuT) party, officials from the Regions Party of Yanukovich gave regular briefings. "Tymoshenko must remember that she is a democrat and not ruin the good reputation of Ukraine," said Regions Party MP Anna German, one of Yanukovich's top lieutenants. Regions Party official Boris Kolesnikov added: "It's time she packed her bags. We have approached the (outgoing) president (Viktor Yushchenko) and the security service so that Tymoshenko recognises the result."Chadian President Idriss Deby Itno Tuesday urged rebels in the restive western Sudanese region of Darfur to abandon violence, saying that the peace talks currently underway in Doha, Qatar, were the ideal platform to resolving the Darfur conflicts. Addressing a gathering of Sudanese politicians and representatives of the Chadian community in Sudan, and with Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir standing beside him, the Chadian president said "the Darfur crisis can not be resolved through military ways, and I urged the armed men in Darfur to stop the hostilities." The visiting Chadian leader also urged the rebel groups in eastern Chad to choose peace, saying that "It is no longer possible to reach power through gun, it can be achieved through voting boxes." Deby asked the Sudanese government to exercise "sufficient flexibility" in the peace negotiations, saying that "the Doha track, which is supported by Chad, is the most suitable choice for realizing peace in the region." He also said "those (Chadians) who live in Sudan should return to their homeland and I promise to provide them all opportunities. " Meanwhile, the Chadian leader stressed his country's desire to overcome differences with Sudan, saying "I have willingly come to Sudan, with my hands extended for peace. I came to transform the calmness in our relations into a comprehensive peace. I have no doubt that President al-Bashir feels the same." Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, for his part, said Sudan and Chad had put aside the differences and the two leaders decided to work together to achieve peace and development in their respective countries. "Today we affirm that we have folded the page of troubles. Our will make joint efforts to achieve peace and development and to provide services for our peoples," he said. He also stressed the importance of coordination between the two countries' leadership to overcome all difficulties, saying "there are enemies for peace in Sudan and Chad. These enemies may move again to undermine the two countries' relations, therefore, we agreed to maintain direct contact between the two countries' leadership to tackle any difference or problem." The Chadian president arrived in Khartoum on Monday on an official tow-day visit, during which he and his Sudanese counterpart held closed-door talks in Khartoum and vowed to overcome differences between their countries and normalize bilateral ties to achieve security along their joint borders. Since the eruption of the Darfur conflicts in 2003, Sudan and Chad had been trading accusations that the other supported rebel groups and interfered in internal affairs, but last October the President Deby considered Khartoum's offer to end hostilities and stop support for rebel movements based on both sides of the borders. Last month, the two countries inked a technical protocol on the establishment of the 3000-strong joint border force that will be led by a Sudanese commander during the first six months. As the April general elections are approaching in Sudan, an improvement of relations between Sudan and its western neighbor Chad could help ease tensions in Darfur and the re-election of the incumbent President al-Bashir.British actor Ian Carmichael, one of the stars of "I'm All Right Jack" and other comedies, has died at age 89. His family says Carmichael died at his home in northern England on Friday after falling ill at the end of last year. Carmichael was a master at embodying a certain type of Englishman: diffident, awkward, often put-upon but unfailingly courteous and well-intentioned. He appeared in a series of comedies for the Boulting Brothers including "Private's Progress," "Brothers in Law," "Lucky Jim" and "I'm All Right Jack." Later in his career he played the upper-class twit Bertie Wooster, and Dorothy L. Sayers suave detective Lord Peter Wimsey, in television series.Albanian President Bamir Topi met on Saturday with Prime Minsiter Sali Berisha and opposition leader Edi Rama in a bid to resolve the political stalemate that has blocked the country for months. "This is a very important opportunity to end the political crisis and pave the way for reforms aimed to lead the country towards European integration," said Thorbjorn Jagland, secretary general of the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly before the start of the talks. The European Union and the United States have urged Albania's politicians to find a solution for the political stallmate that followed legislative polls in June last year. The opposition led by Rama's Socialists has contested the election results, boycotting the parliament and thus blocking the adoption of important reforms in the Balkan republic. The Socialists have demanded a parliamentary probe into the polls, a request that the ruling rightist coalition led by Berisha's Democrats has called "illegitimate". A Council of Europe delegation was expected in Albania in the coming days for talks focused on the political crisis, diplomatic sources in the capital Tirana said. In a resolution adopted in late January, Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly called on Albanian officials to find a solution for the crisis which "has deeply affected" the country's political situation. "In the current situation, the progress of the country towards European integration has become more difficult," the assembly said.Defending champion Marin Cilic of Croatia beat third-seeded Juergen Melzer of Austria 7-6 (5), 6-4, to reach the finals of the Zagreb Indoors tournament. The top-seeded Croatian ousted Melzer in straight sets in one hour and 45 minutes on Saturday to raise his 2010 record to 14-1 and give himself a chance at a second title this year and a fifth of his career. Cilic, 22, won in Chennai, India in January and reached the semifinals of the Australian Open last week to break into the top 10 in the world rankings for the first time this week. In the other semifinal, Michael Berrer of Germany faces compatriot Philipp Petzschner later Saturday.Results from the second day of the Fed Cup opening round tie between the Czech Republic and Germany here on Sunday: Czech Republic 3 Germany 2 Lucie Hradecka (CZE) bt Andrea Petkovic 6-1, 7-6 (7/5) Anna-Lena Groenefeld (GER) bt Petra Kvitova 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 Lucie Hradecka/Kveta Peschke (CZE) bt Anna-Lena Groenefeld/Tatjana Malek (GER) 6-1, 6-3 Saturday: Anna-Lena Groenefeld (GER) bt Lucie Safarova (CZE) 6-2, 6-2 Petra Kvitova (CZE) bt Andrea Petkovic (GER) 6-4, 6-4 Czech Republic qualify for semi-finalsBankers by nature aren't the most jocular bunch. Nowadays, however, they can have the haggard look of a refugee. Bankers have taken a beating in their communities, in the media and from the nation's bully pulpit in D.C. A group of 150-plus gathered in Savannah, Ga., last week to lick their wounds and listen to a pep talk from the new Southeast regional president of Wells Fargo. Darryl Harmon, ensconced now for a year in Atlanta, told the Southeastern Bank Management and Directors Conference presented by UGA's Terry College to make known to all their constituents the difference between community bankers and Wall Street. "There is a difference," he said, between Main Street bankers and those high-flying Wall Street investment types. In other words, it's Wall Street's fault. It is something of the same difference Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, would like to see made more distinct by law. The Volcker Plan would attempt to put the genie back in the bottle by restricting banks from operating hedge funds and making other investments with depositors' money. It would stop them from playing Wall Street's favorite game of gambling with investors' money. Only a handful of the largest would be affected: Bank America, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley. But not Wells Fargo. So for Harmon, the Volcker Plan is a non-issue. Not so with the Obama's plan to tax those banks that took TARP funding. Harmon said taxing banks isn't the best way to help the economy if you want banks to lend more. The tax is doubly ironic for Wells Fargo, which was the one bank that had to be threatened by then Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to take TARP funding. Perhaps executives knew all too well that dealing with Washington is hardly ever what it seems or what the politicians say it is. Payback is never simply paying the bill. The piper must also be compensated. One of the results of the Financial Panic of '08 was that Wells Fargo snatched Wachovia from the jaws of Citigroup, which had been anointed by the FDIC to take over the Charlotte-based bank. Wachovia shareholders cheered. As such Wells Fargo now claims a 19 percent market share in metro Atlanta, behind No. 1 SunTrust, with one in three households having a primary banking relationship with the San Francisco-based holding company. Harmon says it is a myth that bankers aren't making loans, though the latest report from the Federal Reserve would indicate that credit is still tight, as it has been for two years. Of greater concern might be that "demand from both businesses and households for all major categories of loans weakened further, on net, over the past three months," according to the January survey of senior loan officers. Harmon said a lot of Wells Fargo's best customers he would like to lend more to are "waiting on the sidelines." Waiting, as we all are, to see how new taxes and regulations are going to affect their business. Not to mention the escalating size of government that requires an ever increasing budget that creates a deficit for all time. Thomas Oliver writes for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Svetlana Kuznetsova and Alisa Kleybanova beat Jelena Jankovic and Ana Ivanovic 6-1, 6-4. Russia, which has won four of the last six Fed Cup titles, will now meet the United States, who trounced France 4-1, in the semifinals. Earlier Sunday in the reverse singles, Kleybanova beat Ivanovic 6-2, 6-3 while Jankovic defeated Kuznetsova 6-3, 4-6, 6-3.Phil Jackson passed Pat Riley as the coach with the most wins in Los Angeles Lakers history on Wednesday night, but the milestone game left superstar Kobe Bryant hurting. Bryant didn't practice on Thursday, a day after the Lakers eked out a 99-97 NBA victory over the Charlotte Bobcats - Jackson's 534th victory at the helm. "It has been a really good run," said Jackson, who is also the winningest coach in Chicago Bulls history. "Having this opportunity to coach this team is always special. The fact that we've had some great teams, great players, is always a credit to them. It's not really an individual record in my mind." But not everything is rosy for the reigning NBA champions. Bryant aggravated his already-sprained left ankle when Lamar Odom stepped on his foot late in the first half. Bryant was originally injured in a win at Philadelphia last Friday. Bryant didn't score in the fourth quarter, and was held to single digits in scoring for the first time this season with just five points against Charlotte. "It was just stiff - stiff and tight," said Bryant, who has also been playing with a broken finger on his shooting hand. "Lamar stepped on my foot as I was changing directions, so ... it just made it worse. It just set it back to Square One." Jackson acknowledged there was a chance Bryant could sit out Friday's contest against Denver. "Hes working with it," Jackson said on Thursday. "He didnt come out on the court and practice. Hes trying a variety of therapies on it right now to see what will work for him." Bryant's teammates said they would't be surprised to see him in action against Denver. "He usually plays 82 games," Odom said. "That wheel is going to really have to hurt for him not to play." The Lakers were at home on Wednesday for the first time since defeating Orlando on January 18. They went 5-3 on an East Coast road trip and stayed on top of the Western Conference. They'll have little time to rest, however, with a schedule that includes four games in the next seven days."America is ready for another revolution," Sarah Palin declared as she assailed President Barack Obama in a speech before adoring "tea party" activists who would make a seemingly natural constituency if she runs for president. "This movement is about the people," the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee said Saturday as the crowd roared. "Government is supposed to be working for the people." Mocking Obama's 2008 campaign slogan, Palin noted Democrats' U.S. state electoral losses since Obama took office a year ago with talk of hope and promises of change and asked: "How's that hope-y, change-y stuff workin' out for you?" Her audience waved flags and erupted in cheers during multiple standing ovations as Palin gave the keynote address at the first national convention of the "tea party" coalition. It is an anti-establishment, grass-roots network motivated by anger over the growth of government, budget-busting spending and Obama's policies. Filled with Palin's trademark folksy jokes, the speech amounted to a 45-minute pep talk for the coalition and promotion of its principles. The speech also was rife with criticism for Obama and Democrats who control Congress, but delivered with a light touch. But, aside from broad conservative principles like lower taxes and a strong national defense, the speech was short on Palin's own policy ideas that typically indicate someone is seriously laying the groundwork to run for the White House. Indeed, Republican observers say she's seemingly done more lately to establish herself as a political celebrity focused on publicity rather than a political candidate focused on policy. Catering to her crowd, Palin talked of limited government, strict adherence to the Constitution, and the "God-given right" of freedom. She said the "fresh, young and fragile" movement is the future of American politics because it's "a ground-up call to action" to both major political parties to change how they do business. "You've got both party machines running scared," she said. Palin suggested that the party should remain leaderless and cautioned against allowing the movement to be defined by any one person. "This is about the people" and "it's a lot bigger than any charismatic guy with a teleprompter," she said, jabbing at Obama. "Let us not get bogged down in the small squabbles. Let us get caught up in the big ideas," she said, though she offered few of her own. The former Alaska governor, who resigned from office last summer before completing her first term, didn't indicate whether her political future would extend beyond cable news punditry and paid speeches to an actual presidential candidacy. All she offered was a smile when a moderator asking her questions used the phrase "President Palin." That prompted most in the audience to stand up and chant "Run, Sarah, run!" But, given the plethora of attacks that Palin leveled at Obama, she seemed like she was already running against him. And, perhaps, as an independent. She talked little about the Republican Party, going so far as to suggest that she should apologize to the party for her inability to get her husband to register with the Republicans. She also encouraged "tea party"-aligned candidates to compete in Republican primaries, saying: "Contested primaries aren't civil war; they're democracy at work and that's beautiful." Palin criticized Obama for continuing to blame George W. Bush for the country's woes instead of blaming what she called the Democrat's own big-government, big-spending agenda that has made the country less secure. She called his policies out of date and said they were "running out of time," suggesting big Republican wins in the fall mid-term elections. She also ribbed him for Democratic losses in New Jersey and Virginia governor's races last fall and in a Massachusetts Senate race last month, saying: "When you're 0-3 you'd better stop lecturing and start listening." On foreign policy and national security, Palin said he had "misguided thinking" and a pre-Sept. 11, 2001 mindset, saying: "We need a commander in chief" not a professor of law. "Foreign policy can't be managed through the politics of personality," she said. She assailed the $787 billion stimulus plan -- "Did you feel very stimulated?" she asked -- and said the administration's deficit spending was "immoral" and "generational theft." Her fee was $100,000 for the appearance at the for-profit event. But she said she would not keep the money, instead giving it back to "the cause." She didn't elaborate. Admission was $549 for access to the entire three-day gathering or $349 just to hear Palin's speech after a dinner of lobster and steak at the sprawling Gaylord Opryland resort. The cost led to criticism from even some activists that it runs counter to the coalition's image and could preclude people from attending. It's just one of several "tea party" appearances Palin plans in the coming weeks. She will speak at a rally in Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid's hometown of Searchlight, Nevada, to kick off the Tea Party Express III tour. In April, she heads to Boston for "tea party" gathering there around the one-year anniversary of the coalition that began last spring. ------ On the Net: National Tea Party Convention: http://www.nationalteapartyconvention.comPakistan coach Intikhab Alam said Sunday he accepted full responsibility for his team's dismal performance on its tour of Australia last month, and vowed not to run away from any investigation. Pakistan were whitewashed 3-0 in the Tests and 5-0 in the one-dayers and lost the only Twenty20 match on the tour -- results which prompted former players and fans to demand an overhaul of the team and management. Chief selector Iqbal Qasim last week resigned, but Alam said he would not make any premature comments. "I will not run away and will face an investigation," said Alam after the team's return home early Sunday. "I am not going to comment on any resignation but I take full responsibility for the defeat." Pakistan captain Mohammad Yousuf, who returned to Pakistan on Wednesday, also vowed to continue as skipper despite a hint from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that there will be a change in the captaincy. PCB last week announced a six-man evaluation committee to investigate the defeats, which Alam said were due to poor fielding and batting. "It was a disappointing tour but if you look into the history, Pakistan has never performed well on a tour of Australia," said Alam. "Our fielding was very poor and batsmen lacked determination and their shot selection was bad." This was Pakistan's fourth straight 3-0 Test series whitewash against Australia, having lost by the same margin on the tours in 1999 and 2004. Australia also beat them 3-0 when the series was played on neutral venues of Colombo and Sharjah in 2002. The team was whisked away from Karachi's old airport terminal due to security problems in the city, where 33 people were killed in twin bomb blasts amid sectarian violence on Friday. Alam denied there was any rift in the team. "Talk of grouping is baseless and rumours. Such things come when the team loses," said Alam, who replaced Australian Geoff Lawson in October 2008. "Australia is still the best team in the world and they played well. "Australia lost a home Test series against South Africa, were defeated in Tests in India and handed Ashes to England in the last two years, but their people backed them and they have regrouped. We should also back our team." Alam said he would give the PCB a detailed report on team's performance. "I will give a detailed report on team's performance on the tour and hope a fair analysis is done," said Alam, whose last tenure as coach ended after Pakistan lost a Test series 2-1 to Sri Lanka in 2000. When asked about all-rounder Shahid Afridi's ball-tampering case, Alam said: "every team in the world does tamper with the ball, but Afridi's style was unacceptable and different." Afridi, leading Pakistan in the fifth one-day at Perth last Sunday, was caught biting the ball on two separate occasions. He was banned for two Twenty20 matches.Ukrainian opposition leader Viktor Yanukovich led in the country's presidential runoff on Sunday over his competitor incumbent Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, exit polls showed on Sunday. According to an exit poll conducted by the Inter TV, Yanukovich won 49.6 percent while his female challenger secured 44. 5 percent. Most of the others voted for the " Against all" category. Yanukovich also led in several other exit polls, though invariably by small margin as little as three percent. In an exit poll also ordered by Inter and conducted by two sociological companies, FOM-Ukraine and the Ukrainian Sociology Service, 49.78 percent said they voted for Yanukovych, 44.63 percent for Tymoshenko and 5.59 percent against both. The exit poll carried out by the Research & Branding group showed that 50.26 percent of the vote was given to Yanukovich, while 44.02 percent of the votes was given to Tymoshenko. The exit poll is a rough indicator of the final electoral results. Official voting counts will be announced by the Central Election Commission by Feb. 17. Before the showdown, tensions have been mounting as there is increasing evidence that loser of the election would not concede defeat and might take supporters to street protests. The candidates have traded allegations of election violations. Headquarters of the Regions Party, headed by Yanukovich, had asked the Kiev city administration for permission to stage a massive rally outside the Central Election Commission building in the capital on Monday. The application is for the rally of 50,000 participants, said Volodymyr Mayevskiy, head of the Ukrainian Interior Ministry's Public Security Department on Sunday. Tymoshenko has also hinted that she would stage a replay of the Orange Revolution, in which mass protests stripped Yanukovich of an initial victory in 2004 and propelled Viktor Yushchenko to power. Yanukovich seeks mutually beneficial and friendly foreign policies, in contrast to outgoing President Yushchenko's active pursuit of NATO membership and anti- Russian policies. Tymoshenko, born in November 1960, allied herself with Yushchenko in the "Orange Revolution". She became Ukraine's first female prime minister in 2005, but the shortlived political honeymoon with Yushchenko only lasted eight months. She was re- appointed prime minister in 2007.Defending champion Tom Boonen of Quick Step has won the fifth stage at the Tour of Qatar, while Dutch cyclist Wouter Mol of the Vacansoleil Pro Cycling Team retained the overall lead. Boonen won the 142 kilometer stage in a time of 3 hours, 13 minutes on Thursday. The Belgian, a three-time winner in Qatar, finished ahead of Danilo Napolitano of Italy and Edvald Boasson Hagen of Norway. Mol, the overnight leader, has an overall time of 13:12:28 after five stages. Steurs Geert of Belgium is nine seconds back in second, while Boonen is a minute and 45 seconds behind the leader.An exit poll predicted Sunday that opposition leader Viktor Yanukovych has been elected Ukraine's next president, with voters apparently favoring a leader who will steer the country away from the pro-Western course set by the 2004 Orange Revolution. The National Election Poll expected the Russia-leaning Yanukovych to finish first in Sunday's runoff ballot, capturing 48.7 percent of the vote to 45.5 percent for Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, with other voters mostly choosing "Against all." The stone-faced political leader from Ukraine's Russian-speaking east fought hard against Tymoshenko, whose impassioned leadership of the 2004 Orange protests made her an international celebrity. But Sunday's vote appeared to be much closer than the first round Jan. 17, where Yanukovych had a 10 percentage point lead over Tymoshenko. Tymoshenko has vowed to challenge a vote she claims was rigged. Yanukovych supporters have been camped out in front of the Central Election Commission headquarters in Kiev in an apparent effort to prevent Tymoshenko supporters from blockading the building. Yanukovych has pledged to restore order and says he will try to balance ties to east and west. But he represents the hopes of many in eastern Ukraine, who feel they have been relegated to second-class status by their countrymen in western Ukraine. Tymoshenko sought to depict herself as a populist whose appeal crossed Ukraine's east-west divide. But she bore the scars of five years of political battles with Yanukovych and her sometime Orange ally, outgoing President Viktor Yushchenko, and has struggled to cope with Ukraine's severe economic crisis. Yanukovych was accused of massive vote fraud in the 2004 president ballot, which was thrown out by the courts. Later that year he was trounced by Orange forces in a revote as foes cast him as a Kremlin lackey. But he battled back, serving for a time as prime minister under his Orange adversary, Yushchenko. Yanukovych's rise from the political ashes came as voters said they were weary of broken promises, a dysfunctional economy and political chaos under the Orange government.British papers applauded the sacking of England captain John Terry Saturday, praising manager Fabio Capello for stamping his authority on the team ahead of the looming World Cup. The Sun newspaper reported that Terry was not ruling out a return ahead of the crucial tournament in South Africa which starts in June. It said the Chelsea captain was heard to say: "If there's a one percent chance of being World Cup captain, I will fight for it tooth and nail". Most papers, though, turned their attention to Capello, praising the Italian manager's uncompromising stance after Terry's alleged affair with the ex- girlfriend of England team-mate Wayne Bridge. "Grazie, Signor Capello" -- "Thank You Mr Capello" in Italian -- was the front page headline on the Daily Mail. "We applaud manager Fabio Capello (an Italian with strong Catholic values) for taking only ten minutes yesterday to strip Terry of the England captaincy," the paper's editorial said. "John Terry is captain of England and a role model to millions of young boys. "That is why, by sacking Terry, Mr Capello has delivered a long overdue reminder that even millionaire sportsmen have a duty to behave with a modicum of decency". The Times hailed Capello's decisiveness in dealing with the situation. "The one clear winner has been the personal authority of Capello. That is why yesterday was an excellent day for English football," it said in an editorial. The Sun added: "It sent out a message to players and fans alike that was loud and clear: 'I'm in charge'". Elsewhere, though, questions were raised about the suitability of Terry's apparent successor, Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand. "Rocky road to top job for Rio" was the headline in the Daily Express, which recalled that Ferdinand was banned for eight months in 2004 for missing a drugs test. "From cause celebre to captain. Rio Ferdinand has made a remarkable journey from England outcast to Three Lions skipper," the Daily Mirror added.Sarah Palin is predicting a good year for conservative candidates for public office, saying the policies of President Barack Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress will be short-lived. The 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee told the national "tea party" convention on Saturday that a string of recent Republican victories at the polls, including Scott Brown's longshot win in last month's special Senate election in Massachusetts, bodes well for conservative candidates this year. She told the convention in Tennessee that if there's hope for the tea party movement in Massachusetts, there's hope everywhere.Miguel Angel Jimenez has defeated Lee Westwood in a sudden death playoff to win the Dubai Desert Classic. Westwood missed a five-foot par putt on the third playoff hole Sunday, and Jimenez then calmly sank a four-footer for the win. Both players went into the final day with a share of the lead and shot an even-par 72 in the final round. Thongchai Jaidee of Thailand was also tied for the overnight lead but shot a 73 to finish third.Third-seeded Feliciano Lopez of Spain has secured his second career ATP tour title by beating Stephane Robert of France 7-5, 6-1 in the SA Open final. The 39th-ranked Lopez broke in last game of the first set Sunday and then cruised in the second to earn his first title since 2004. The Spaniard never faced a break point. Lopez beat the top-seeded Gael Monfils in the semifinals and said the high altitude suited his style of play as it led to a faster pace. He said that "to win again is very sweet." Robert was playing in his first career ATP final.Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she regards the greatest threat to the United States to be weapons of mass destruction in the hands of an international terrorist group. "The biggest nightmare that many of us have is that one of these terrorist member organizations within this syndicate of terror will get their hands on a weapon of mass destruction," Clinton told CNN's "State of the Union" program in a taped interview. That's "the most, yes, threatening prospect we see," she said. Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the U.S., the al-Qaida terrorist network has become "more creative, more flexible, more agile," Clinton said, according to a transcript of the interview. "They are unfortunately a very committed, clever, diabolical group of terrorists who are always looking for weaknesses and openings." A nuclear-armed North Korea or Iran "poses both a real or a potential threat," Clinton said. "But I think that most of us believe the greater threats are the trans-national non-state networks. Primarily the extremists -- the fundamentalist Islamic extremists who are connected to al-Qaida in the Arab peninsula." North Korea has detonated two nuclear devices and tested several missiles. The communist regime has said it isn't willing to return to multilateral nuclear disarmament talks while the country is subject to United Nations sanctions. Asked if she was convinced that Iran had a nuclear weapon, Clinton said "no," acknowledging there is "some debate" over how close they may be to developing a weapon. The U.S., its European allies and United Nations inspectors suspect Iran is using its uranium enrichment program to build a nuclear bomb. The U.S. wants more United Nations sanctions aimed at halting the program, which Iran, with the world's second-biggest oil and natural gas reserves, says is for peaceful uses such as power generation. The U.N.'s atomic agency said last year it had lost confidence in the truthfulness of Iran after learning the country had concealed its Fordo nuclear facility, about 100 miles south of Tehran near the Islamic holy city of Qom. "We believe that their behavior certainly is evidence of their intentions," Clinton said. "The failure to disclose the facility at Qom. The failure to accept what was a very reasonable offer by Russia, France, and the U.S. through the IAEA to take their uranium -- their low enriched uranium -- and return it for their research reactor." On Afghanistan, Clinton said she thinks President Hamid Karzai "has really stepped up" since he was re-elected and that "we're making progress" there. Clinton also said her daughter Chelsea hasn't bought a wedding dress yet. Asked which was harder -- Middle East peace or negotiating her daughter's wedding -- Clinton said, `I'd probably call a draw about that one."As the backup to Peyton Manning, Indianapolis Colts rookie Curtis Painter finds himself behind the NFL's most durable quarterback, and he'll likely watch the entire Super Bowl from the sideline. It's the same for Mark Brunell, the backup to New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees. With one jarring hit, Brunell could find himself playing a pivotal role in the biggest game of his life. Even if Brunell and Painter don't play, they're thrilled to be in the Super Bowl for the first time. It has been an especially rewarding week for Brunell, a 17-year veteran and a three-time Pro Bowl player who twice led Jacksonville to the AFC Championship game in the 1990s. With the Saints, he has gone a step further. "A dream come true," the 39-year-old Brunell said. "This has been a long time coming. To have this opportunity with this team is really special, but it's only truly special if we win this game." Brunell struggled in the Saints' final regular-season game, when he made his first start since 2006 so Brees could rest for the playoffs. Painter stumbled in a much more significant situation, failing to protect a lead when he made his NFL debut by spelling Manning in a late-December loss to the New York Jets that spoiled the Colts' bid for a perfect season. "You go in and try to pick up where the guy in front of you left off," Painter said. "Unfortunately it didn't go the way we wanted, but I tried to learn from it and get better." Painter also played in a loss at Buffalo the following week. He finished the regular season 8 for 28 for 83 yards with two interceptions. It was more experience than the Colts planned this season for Painter. A sixth-round draft pick in April, Painter is one of two quarterbacks from Purdue University in the Super Bowl. Brees preceded him by nearly a decade, and they've spent time together at Brees' offseason quarterback camp. "I'm happy for Curtis," Brees said. "I followed his career very closely at Purdue. I've always been impressed with him, just the way that he has handled everything, both the ups and downs. To get an opportunity to play at the next level and be a backup to one of the best quarterbacks of all time, that's great for him. Obviously you're not getting a whole lot of reps sitting behind Peyton Manning, but I've been happy for him." While Painter's unlikely to leave the bench on Sunday, Brunell should see at least some action because he holds for place kicks. And there will be intangible contributions from the left-hander, who has appeared in 13 playoff games. "There's a confidence level about him that is somewhat contagious," Saints coach Sean Payton said. "That's a good trait to have when you are someone who could be called upon at any time." Brunell described himself as "beyond a veteran" and laughed when asked what he brings to the team. "A lot of age," he said. "Maybe in a game like this, having been in big games, I bring a level of confidence being able to put guys at ease by saying, 'Hey listen, this is a big game, but just be who you are, do what you do and you'll be fine.'" What the backup quarterbacks likely will do is a lot of watching. Brees hasn't missed a game because of injury since 2004, and Manning's 192 consecutive starts is the longest career-opening streak of any quarterback in NFL history. Still, Brunell and Painter have memorized the backup's motto. "You're always one snap away," Painter said. "You've always got to be ready." Especially in the Super Bowl.Four-time champion Russia won the decisive doubles match Sunday to edge Serbia 3-2 in the Fed Cup quarterfinals. Svetlana Kuznetsova and Alisa Kleybanova beat Jelena Jankovic and Ana Ivanovic 6-1, 6-4. Russia, which has won four of the last six Fed Cup titles, will now meet the United States, who trounced France 4-1, in the semifinals. Earlier Sunday in the reverse singles, Kleybanova beat Ivanovic 6-2, 6-3 while Jankovic defeated Kuznetsova 6-3, 4-6, 6-3.In expansive remarks at a law school in Florida, Justice Clarence Thomas on Tuesday vigorously defended the Supreme Court's recent campaign finance decision. And Thomas explained that he did not attend State of the Union addresses -- he missed the dust-up when President Barack Obama used the occasion last week to criticize the court's decision -- because the gatherings had turned so partisan. Thomas responded to several questions from students at Stetson University College of Law in Gulfport, Fla., concerning the campaign finance case, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. By a 5-4 vote, with Thomas in the majority, the court ruled last month that corporations had a First Amendment right to spend money to support or oppose political candidates. "I found it fascinating that the people who were editorializing against it were The New York Times Co. and The Washington Post Co.," Thomas said. "These are corporations." The part of the McCain-Feingold law struck down in Citizens United contained an exemption for news reports, commentaries and editorials. But Thomas said that reflected a legislative choice rather than a constitutional principle. He added that the history of congressional regulation of corporate involvement in politics had a dark side, pointing to the Tillman Act, which banned corporate contributions to federal candidates in 1907. "Go back and read why Tillman introduced that legislation," Thomas said, referring to Sen. Benjamin Tillman. "Tillman was from South Carolina, and as I hear the story he was concerned that the corporations, Republican corporations, were favorable toward blacks and he felt that there was a need to regulate them." It is thus a mistake, the justice said, to applaud the regulation of corporate speech as "some sort of beatific action." Thomas said the First Amendment's protections applied regardless of how people chose to assemble to participate in the political process. "If 10 of you got together and decided to speak, just as a group, you'd say you have First Amendment rights to speak and the First Amendment right of association," he said. "If you all then formed a partnership to speak, you'd say we still have that First Amendment right to speak and of association." "But what if you put yourself in a corporate form?" Thomas asked, suggesting that the answer must be the same. Asked about his attitude toward the two decisions overruled in Citizens United, he said, "If it's wrong, the ultimate precedent is the Constitution." Thomas would not directly address the controversy over Obama's criticism of the Citizens United ruling or Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr.'s mouthed "not true" in response. But he did say he had stopped attending the addresses. "I don't go because it has become so partisan and it's very uncomfortable for a judge to sit there," he said, adding that "there's a lot that you don't hear on TV -- the catcalls, the whooping and hollering and under-the-breath comments." "One of the consequences," he added in an apparent reference to last week's address, "is now the court becomes part of the conversation, if you want to call it that, in the speeches. It's just an example of why I don't go."World number 215 Christina Mchale has been called in to replace Shenay Perry in the US women's team that plays France here in the first round of the Fed Cup World Group at the weekend. Perry, ranked 148th, is suffering from a wrist injury and US captain Mary-Jo Fernandez decided to call up the 17-year-old Mchale. Fernandez added that she regretted the decision by the Williams sisters, Serena and Venus, to attend Sunday's Super Bowl rather than coming to northern France to represent their country. "I hope they'll come one day," Fernandez said.Results from the sixth day of the ATP South African Open here on Saturday (x denotes seeding): Semi-finals Feliciano Lopez (ESP x3) bt Gael Monfils (FRA x1) 3-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7/1) Stephane Robert (FRA x8) bt David Ferrer (ESP x2) 7-5, 6-4Birmingham raided local rivals Aston Villa to sign former England Under-21 midfielder Craig Gardner for three million pounds on Tuesday. Gardner, 23, agreed a four-and-a-half-year contract with Alex McLeish's team after opting to quit Villa Park in search of more regular first-team action. He had made just 32 league starts for Villa since making his debut in 2005 and becomes Birmingham's second signing of the transfer window following McLeish's swoop for Sporting Gijon midfielder Michel. McLeish, bolstered by new owner Carson Yeung's funds, also admitted he is keen to sign a striker and winger before the transfer window closes on February 1. He is interested in Spurs striker Roman Pavlyuchenko, while Liverpool winger Ryan Babel is another target. "I am building a squad. We have to have a squad of players and it is about enhancing the quality as you go along - and Craig Gardner will enhance the quality of the squad," McLeish said. "From two years ago to now, this is a major signing for us because we wouldn't have been able to do this two seasons ago. "Are any other deals close to being completed? There is nothing close but we are trying a couple of things. "I still believe we have to spend some more money to bring in a striker and a wide man for more cover."UN atomic agency chief Yukiya Amano said Saturday that Iran's foreign minister made no new proposals to him on a possible nuclear fuel deal during a meeting in Germany. "There was not a new proposal. We exchanged views," Amano told reporters after meeting Manouchehr Mottaki on the sidelines of a security forum in Munich. "I didn't receive the counter-proposal." Asked if he was confident of a breakthrough on a deal, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head said: "I am not providing my perspective. Dialogue is continuing and should be accelerated, that is the point." "Our meeting covered a variety of areas. That included of course in Iran and the Tehran research reactor. We had a very interesting discussion, and on my part I can currently say that dialogue is continuing and should be accelerated." Tehran appeared to reject last October a deal proposed by the IAEA for Iran to export low-enriched uranium (LEU) to France and Russia to be further purified into fuel for a research reactor in Tehran. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad suddenly said on Tuesday however that he would have "no problem" sending some LEU abroad, although he gave no details on how a possible deal might look. EU and US officials, wearied by years of fruitless talks to persuade Iran to suspend uranium enrichment and ease concerns about its atomic ambitions, suspect the move is brinkmanship to avert a fourth round of sanctions.President Ali Abdullah Saleh has appointed a new governor for Saada, the province in northern Yemen at the centre of a Zaidi Shiite revolt, the defence ministry's website reported on Saturday. "A presidential decree issued today appointed Abdullah Taha Hajar governor of Saada province," the 26sep.net website said, without giving a reason for the replacement of the current governor, Hassan Mohammed Manaa. Manaa's brother, Sheikh Fares, is alleged to Yemen's biggest arms dealer and was arrested on January 28. Local sources said that Saada-based Shiite rebels last month stole weapons from arms depots owned by Sheikh Fares. He did not report the theft until two days later, allowing the rebels to make off with around 20 truckloads of arms. The incident angered Sanaa, which has been pressing an all-out assault on the rebels since August, the sources said.Flavia Pennetta beat Alona Bondarenko 7-5, 7-6 (3) Sunday to give defending champion Italy a 2-1 lead over Ukraine in the Fed Cup quarterfinals. Both players struggled with their serve in a match that saw nine breaks, but Pennetta proved stronger at the end of each set. Bondarenko held a 4-2 lead in the first set and had a break point for 5-3 before Pennetta rallied, and the Italian then dominated the second-set tiebreaker to clinch the win. Kateryna Bondarenko played Francesca Schiavone in the final singles match later Sunday, followed by a potentially decisive doubles match.Former 1970s teen idol Leif Garrett has been released from jail on a charge he carried heroin into a Los Angeles subway station. Los Angeles County sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore says the actor and singer was arrested late Monday for heroin possession and released on bond Wednesday. Whitmore told the Los Angeles Times the 48-year-old was shaking and sweating. Whitmore says Garrett denied having drugs at first and allowed them to search him, then acknowledged that he had black tar heroin in his shoe. Garrett has a history of drug use, including a 2006 arrest at another Los Angeles subway stop for having heroin. He is due back in court Feb. 24. It was not immediately clear if Garrett had an attorney.Miguel Angel Jimenez defeated Lee Westwood on the third hole of a sudden death playoff Sunday to win the Dubai Desert Classic. Westwood missed a five-foot par putt on the third playoff hole to leave Jimenez with a four-footer for the win, which he calmly sank for the 16th victory of his career. "After so many years of coming to Dubai and playing well, I am proud to have finally won this title," the Spaniard said. "I have always loved the course, the ambiance and the people here." Both players went into the final day with a share of the lead and shot an even-par 72 in the final round, with Westwood making a birdie on the 18th to force the playoff. The Englishman then missed two birdie putts from within 20 feet on the first two playoff holes that could have clinched the win, while Jimenez made a 12-footer on the second to save par. Thongchai Jaidee of Thailand and Alvaro Quiros or Spain were also tied for the overnight lead but faded in the final round. Thongchai shot a 73 to finish third, while Quiros ended up in a tie for sixth after a 75 as strong crosswinds and faster greens led to higher scores than in previous rounds at the Emirates Golf Club. One player who broke the mold, however, was Tom Watson. The 60-year-old veteran once again showed his mastery of windy conditions to shoot a 68 -- his best score of the week-- and climb to a share of eighth place on his first visit to Dubai. "The wind made it a more difficult golf course," Watson said. "And since I had not played it before this week I was pretty happy about the way I played. But my driving probably wasn't as good as it need to be to contend for the title."The executive branch will brief the legislature Wednesday on the first round of talks with China on a proposed bilateral economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA). It will mark the first time that senior officials responsible for the issue have briefed the legislature on progress on the controversial deal that has yet to win a consensus in society. Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang and Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan will lead a group of working-level officials in giving the briefing at a meeting chaired by Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng. The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issues: Liberty Times: In response to criticism of the lack of transparency in the government's handling of cross-Taiwan Strait engagements, senior officials will brief lawmakers Wednesday on the first round of cross-strait ECFA talks held in Beijing Jan. 26. Only lawmakers from the ruling Kuomintang and its allied Non-Partisan Solidarity Union will attend. The legislative caucus of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Tuesday it will boycott the event because it is being held "outside the legislative system." KMT legislative whip Lin Hung-chih said the DPP's boycott could not be justified, as listening to the briefing will help lawmakers better grasp the process behind negotiations on the trade accord. Moreover, Lin added, the administration has not rejected legislative supervision within the legislature's system since the MAC has agreed to give regular reports on ECFA talks to the legislature's economics and internal administration committees. On the DPP proposal that the legislature set up a special panel to oversee cross-strait engagements and treaty talks, Speaker Wang said he already conveyed the message to President Ma Ying-jeou. Ma did not express his own opinion but said instead that the KMT legislative caucus should further discuss such a proposal. The caucus vetoed the proposal on the ground that the legislature already has an effective mechanism to supervise cross-strait engagements and did not need to create redundant bodies. (Feb. 3, 2010) United Daily News: Former Vice President Annette Lu will interview President Ma Ying-jeou Thursday in her capacity as Formosa Media Co. founder. Lu said Tuesday her interview will focus on a range of topics, including cross- strait relations, national defense, and diplomatic, financial, economic and social issues. On cross-strait relations, Lu said, the government should forge a national consensus first. Regrettably, she complained, the Ma administration has often struck deals or signed accords with China before informing the legislature. (Feb. 3, 2010)Rio Ferdinand was left facing the prospect of a three-match ban after being charged with violent conduct on Tuesday by the Football Association (FA) and so missing Wednesday's League Cup semi-final against Manchester City, The Manchester United defender faces disciplinary action after clashing with Hull forward Craig Fagan during the second half of Saturday's 4-0 Premier League victory at Old Trafford that saw champions United return to the top of the table. England international Ferdinand has until 1800GMT Wednesday to respond to the charge. Ferdinand has the option of accepting the charge, for which the standard punishment is a three-game ban, by pleading guilty, or contesting the decision, which would lead to a disciplinary hearing on Thursday. The FA, after initial confusion about the start date of any ban, said Tuesday that if Ferdinand pleaded guilty before 1800GMT Wednesday he would still miss the League Cup semi-final second leg at home to Manchester City. But should he appeal and play against City, he runs the risk of an extended ban if officials believe his contesting the decision was merely a way to play in the derby by delaying implementation of the ban. Were Ferdinand to accept an immediate ban, he would be ruled out of the matches against City, Arsenal and Portsmouth at Old Trafford on February 6. Should he play against City, the third match of any suspension would be against Aston Villa on February 10. Ferdinand has only recently returned to action after three months out with a back injury and United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has no doubt over the importance of the player he signed for 29.1 million pounds from Leeds to his team. "Rio's performance level is important," said Ferguson. "It is important to have him back because getting the centre-halves fit is key to our progress this season." City, bidding for the first major trophy since winning the 1976 League Cup, are 2-1 up after the first leg.Republican Representative Lincoln Diaz-Balart, one of Cuban leader Fidel Castro's fiercest foes in the US Congress, announced Thursday he would not seek reelection in November and would retire in January. At a Miami press conference, the Havana-born lawmaker, 55, said one of his proudest achievements in his nearly two decades in the House of Representatives was authoring legislation to tighten the half-century-old US embargo on Cuba. But "I am convinced that in the upcoming chapter of the struggle, I can be more useful to the inevitable change that will soon come to Cuba, to Cuba's freedom, as a private citizen," said Diaz-Balart, a lawyer by training. His retirement brings to nearly 20 the number of Republicans not seeking a new term in November mid-term elections that will decide control of the US Congress, against roughly a dozen Democrats who have said they will retire. Diaz-Balart, like other members of Florida's congressional delegation, has taken a hard line on Cuba, resisting efforts to ease the embargo imposed in stages after the 1959 revolution that swept Castro to power. Since taking office in January 2009, US President Barack Obama has moved to ease tensions with small steps such as relaxing rules on visits and money transfers to the island. But so far, the US administration has not taken major strides in its approach to the Americas' only communist regime. Diaz-Balart is the son of pre-communist Cuba legislator Rafael Diaz Balart, who became a leader of the Cuban exile community in the United States. At one time, he was also brother-in-law to former Cuban president Fidel Castro. Rafael Diaz Balart died in May 2005 from leukemia.John Terry's future as England captain may be decided Friday after days of pressure over his alleged extra-marital affair with the former partner of a team-mate. Head coach Fabio Capello flew into England Thursday and will make a decision soon on whether to strip the defender of the captaincy just months before the World Cup in South Africa. Reports the married 29-year-old had an affair with model Vanessa Perroncel, the former partner of international team-mate Wayne Bridge, have sharply divided opinion in football-mad England. Capello returned to England after recuperating from a recent knee operation in Switzerland and was expected to decide on Terry's future before Sunday's draw for Euro 2012 qualifying in Warsaw. But the Italian faces a tricky judgement over how to respond to a situation which has triggered heated debate -- he will be severely criticised whatever course of action he takes. A poll published Friday highlighted just how split the English public are over the fate of their football team's captain. While the majority -- 46 percent of those quizzed -- thought Terry should be made to stand down, this was not far off the number who favoured him keeping the job, which came in at 39 percent. And just over half of respondents thought there was no need for the public to know about the affair, while 44 percent believed the interest legitimate, in the PoliticsHome poll that questioned more than 1,000 Britons. Terry's alleged affair has resulted in him being pilloried, in the words of one columnist, as a "five-star scumbag" while numerous football figures have accused him of breaking a dressing room taboo by getting involved with the former partner of Bridge. As Dave Bassett, the former Wimbledon and Sheffield Utd manager, put it: "I've had players who have left their missus or had bits and pieces on the side but they've not gone off with a team-mate's bird. That's crossing a line and where it comes unstuck with Terry." But former England manager Graham Taylor took a measured view, saying Capello would think of how the decision to strip Terry of the captaincy would affect his performance as the team heads into the World Cup. "The most important thing is how he performs as a player, not that he's the captain," Taylor told BBC radio. Capello could opt to take the view that events in Terry's private life are none of his business and have no bearing on the player's role with England. But that line may be untenable if -- as has been reported -- Bridge is not willing to be part of an England squad led by Terry. On the other hand, if he decides to drop Terry in order to accommodate Bridge, Capello will be accused of undermining England's chances of winning the World Cup in South Africa later this year. Bridge, who is currently England's second-choice left-back but by no means assured of making Capello's final squad for the World Cup, has not made any public comment. Terry has so far resisted calls for him to resign the captaincy and issued a statement on Tuesday saying he would not be making a decision before he had spoken to Capello. Reports of Terry's infidelity were published after a High Court judge lifted an injunction on the media barring disclosure of the alleged affair, ruling that it could not be justified under current English law.Top seed Gael Monfils stayed on course for a third ATP title with a 6-4, 7-5 victory over friend and fellow Frenchman Josselin Ouanna in a South African Open second-round tie here on Thursday. Paris-born Monfils, who has won tournaments in Poland and his homeland, is ranked 13 in the world, 108 places above Ouanna from the town of Tours 200 kilometres south west of the French capital. But that huge gap was never evident at the Montecasino entertainment centre in an upmarket suburb of the South African financial capital as Monfils took 79 minutes to subdue a former French tennis academy room-mate. Monfils, who is hoping to emulate compatriot Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and collect the 80,000-dollar first prize on Sunday, triumphed because he served better and produced several timely top-drawer strokes. But it was not a vintage performance from the 23-year-old Frenchman, who committed 37 unforced errors in perfect conditions after rain and thunder forced an afternoon delay. And while the potent 200-kilometre-per-hour Monfils service delivered 12 aces he will be concerned by six double faults ahead of a last-eight duel against Taiwanese Yen-Hsun Lu on Friday. Ouanna emphasised early on that he was not going to be overawed in the first ATP clash between them as he fell 3-1 behind only to break Monfils service in the fifth game. The set then went with service until the 10th game when Ouanna contributed to his downfall by serving one of his four double faults during the game while Monfils conjured a textbook cross-court winner. Each Frenchman held service in the second set until Ouanna finally cracked 12 games into the struggle as he failed to keep a wide return in and a relieved Monfils was through. "It was tough playing against someone I once shared a room with and I am happy to have succeeded. Perhaps one day we will meet in a Grand Slam event," said Monfils. "I like the centre court here and each day I get more used to the altitude and am hopeful of going all the way and winning the final with the crowd behind me." The other three second round ties were also settled in straight sets with seeds David Ferrer (two) of Spain and Lu (seven) and India Davis Cup star Somdev Devverman progressing.John Terry was Friday stripped of the England captaincy following reports of an extra-marital affair with the ex-girlfriend of international team-mate Wayne Bridge, the Football Association (FA) confirmed. The move followed a meeting between Terry and England's head coach, Fabio Capello, at FA headquarters at Wembley. In a statement, Capello said: "After much thought, I have made the decision that it will be best for me to take the captaincy away from John Terry. "As a captain with the team, John Terry has displayed extremely positive behaviour. However, I have to take into account other considerations and what is best for all of the England squad. "What is best for all of the England team has inspired my choice. John Terry was notified first."Northern Ireland's second largest political party, the Republican Sinn Fein, said on Thursday it believed that, after 10 days of negotiation with the largest party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the basis for a deal on the devolution of justice and policing from the UK Parliament has been reached. Sinn Fein junior minister Gerry Kelly said "The negotiations have come to a conclusion. We believe that it is a positive conclusion and we believe that it is the basis on which to move forward" and "there was the basis for an agreement." The DUP and Sinn Fein are part of the Northern Ireland Executive, the government formed from the power-sharing provincial parliament, the Northern Ireland Assembly. Relations between the two parties broke down towards the end of last month over the issue of devolving justice and policing powers from the centralized, national government sitting in Westminster to the provincial government, the Northern Ireland Assembly. Both parties want the justice and policing powers devolved to the provincial government but the DUP says the community is not ready and also wants reform of the Parades Commission, which oversees the contentious issue of parades in the province. Sinn Fein threatened to withdraw from the provincial government, which would have sparked an election for the Northern Ireland Assembly. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and his Irish counterpart, the Taoiseach Brian Cowen met in London 11 days ago to discuss the sudden crisis, and both then flew to Northern Ireland to broker talks between the parties. Both prime ministers gave the Northern Ireland parties a deadline of last Friday to reach agreement, or they would publish their own proposals. This deadline was broken with no action taken.Chelsea will leave strikers Didier Drogba and Salomon Kalou out of their squad for Saturday's trip to Burnley following their Ivory Coast pair's return from the African Nations Cup. Chelsea coach Carlo Ancelotti wants to give the duo more time to recover from the long journey from Angola, but insisted they were fit and ready to go. "They need to work for some days and so will not able to play tomorrow," Ancelotti said. "They will play on Tuesday against Hull. "Didier will stay here to train. He has come back very well, also Kalou. They are fit but they travelled yesterday and so we don't want to take the risk for the next games." A win over Burnley would allow Chelsea to open up a four-point lead over Manchester United at the top of the table, 24 hours before United take on third- placed Arsenal at the Emirates. "Our job is to win and play well tomorrow and then we can watch a fantastic game between Manchester United and Arsenal," Ancelotti said. "I am focused for tomorrow. If we are able to win, any result between United and Arsenal is good for us. "But the Arsenal game is not a decisive match in terms of the title because there are a lot of games until the end of the season. "We could be in a very good position if we win our next two games. It won't be easy though because Burnley and Hull are teams involved in the bottom of the table, so they will put strong pressure and determination into the game. "So we have to pay attention. We played very well at home against Birmingham and Sunderland and we want to do the same away." Kalou said he had been keen to get straight back into action. "I thought I had a good game for Chelsea against Fulham before we left and now I come back in good form," he said. Chelsea have not shown any signs of missing their African stars, with Nicolas Anelka in freescoring form in their absence, and Kalou acknowledged he now faces a fight for first-team chances. "In Africa we were lucky because we had the Premier League on TV, so I watched the Sunderland game (Chelsea won 7-2), which was amazing," he said. "We were in touch with England all the time. "The team has been playing a different system and with the 4-3-2-1, we played it in the second half against Fulham in December and played much better. "It is a great way of playing, everyone has been at their best and it is nice to watch. I have been here almost four years and I have played in every system, so I know that I can adapt to it."FBI agents from Ohio were in Atlanta Wednesday interviewing officials of the national Southern Christian Leadership Conference as part of the federal investigation of Rev. Raleigh Trammell and the Dayton SCLC, according to Special Agent Mike Brooks of the FBI Cincinnati. National SCLC member Art Rocker said he and two other national SCLC officials met with agents from Ohio and Georgia, along with Fulton County, Ga. officials. Rocker said authorities asked about Trammell and the SCLC's use of federal funds in Ohio, along with allegations that Trammell and National SCLC Treasurer Spiver Gordon embezzled $569,000 from the civil rights group. Lynn Hulsey writes for the Dayton Daily News.

Filip Prpic, Sweden, 6-3, 6-4 Somdev Devvarman, India, def. Thiago Alves, Brazil, 6-4, 6-1Franck Ribery will have to wait to win his Bayern Munich place back with rising German star Thomas Mueller and Dutch play-maker Arjen Robben bossing the midfield, coach Louis van Gaal said Sunday. The France star came off the bench in both of Bayern's last two wins over Bremen and Saturday's 3-0 victory over Mainz having recovered from his troublesome knee injury which saw him miss most of last autumn. But with Mueller being called into the Germany squad on the back of his Munich performances and Robben hitting his second goal in consecutive Bundesliga matches against Mainz, Ribery's rivals are playing very well. "Franck can see that we are playing well without him," Bayern coach Louis van Gaal told German daily Bild on Sunday after his side's seventh straight league win. "I have to integrate him back into the team, but it is not so simple. "He has not played regularly for three months now and the team have played outstandingly well at a high level. "Franck is not ready yet, we saw that against Mainz and Bremen." Ribery played the last 20 minutes against Bremen and then 30 minutes against Mainz as van Gaal looks to give him more and more game time to win back full fitness. With Bayern facing defending champions Wolfsburg next Saturday in the Bundesliga, Ribery looks set to start the game on the bench. With the World Cup less than five months away, Ribery looks set to be part of the France squad who have drawn Mexico, Uruguay and hosts South Africa in Group A of the tournament which takes place from June 11-July 11.French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel brushed off President Barack Obama's decision not to attend an annual summit with European leaders while stressing Thursday the importance of Russia as a European partner. A U.S. State Department deputy briefing reporters made the announcement Monday that Obama would miss the EU-U.S. summit in May that will take place in Spain, which now holds the rotating EU presidency. Since then, European media have been awash with commentary wondering what the White House's snub means for Europe as it struggles to find a united voice in foreign affairs following the creation of the new posts of EU president and foreign minister. "With the United States, I don't understand the debate," Sarkozy told a news conference with Merkel after a joint meeting of the entire French and German governments in Paris. "Where is the drama? Is that our only problem in the world today?" he continued. Obama already had miffed Merkel by skipping the ceremonies marking the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall in November, and she was more taciturn. She said that along with Sarkozy and other EU leaders, she would discuss the issue at an informal summit in Brussels next week. Sarkozy indicated that Obama might choose to meet with European leaders in the fall when the U.S. president would be expected to attend the annual NATO leaders summit which this year is in Portugal -- a combined solution the French leader said was a "rather good idea." "If the summit is in November instead of May, it truly doesn't matter. My feeling is that there are too many summits. There are too many trips. There is too much time lost," Sarkozy said. Sarkozy said he was not at all worried by Obama missing the May summit. He noted that Obama had met European leaders on numerous occasions in 2009. The U.S. leader traveled to Europe half a dozen times last year and met European leaders at other international venues, including at the United Nations. "I don't think it demonstrates a lack of interest by President Obama for Europe," Sarkozy said. Sarkozy and Merkel stressed the importance of their relationship with Russia. Both Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin are scheduled to visit France in coming months. The French leader said that he wanted France and Germany to be in total harmony regarding relations with Russia, while Merkel said Russia's relationship with Europe was a "central question." "We have to end the Cold War," she said. Sarkozy and Merkel were meeting for the first time with their entire governments since the German leader's re-election. They outlined a roadmap for bilateral relations until 2020, aiming to strengthen their joint leadership role in Europe. Most of the proposals concerned economy, education, climate change, civil affairs and immigration. The two countries pledged greater cooperation on Afghanistan, fighting nuclear proliferation and transatlantic security. Concerning the biggest issue of the day, however, the fate of the financing of the A400M military transport plane that is over budget and behind schedule, both leaders said only that a solution would be found.Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho on Saturday dismissed his midweek spat with teenage striker Mario Balotelli, saying there was nothing to talk about. Mourinho hauled Balotelli off midway through the second half of their 1-0 Coppa Italia, semi-final, first-leg victory over Fiorentina on Wednesday after the forward failed to get back and defend when instructed too by his coach. The Portuguese boss then criticised his errant young striker after the game for not putting the team's needs before his own -- Balotelli considered himself to be injured at the time. That sparked speculation in the press that one or other would have to leave Inter as Mourinho has oft berated his player for his attitude. But the former Chelsea manager said there was nothing to discuss. "I'm not bothered what the press thinks about our relationship. I liked what Mario did against Chievo, AC Milan, Juventus and also against Fiorentina, even though a perfect player is one who forgets about his lost contact lens when his team is in trouble," said Mourinho. "Jokingly I said he should even forget about it if he loses an eye. But there's no Balotelli case and he's part of the squad as per usual (this weekend). "Against Fiorentina, at a certain point I decided to settle for the 1-0 and take off a forward. "(Goran) Pandev had just come on, (Diego) Milito is Milito and I opted for Balotelli, also because he had just shown me that he wasn't prepared to suffer right up to the last minute." Mourinho, whose side sit eight points clear at the top of the table ahead of Sunday's visit of Cagliari, was in relaxed mood, even joking about a comment he'd made the day before about neurons. "I went to pick up by son who was playing with two friends and their parents thanked me because their children of seven-eight years went to ask them what a neuron was. "I consdier that a contribution to culture."Reigning two-time US men's figure skating champion Jeremy Abbott said Saturday that he was counting on Japanese family connections to help him onto the podium in Vancouver. Japan's former world figure skating champion Yuka Sato coaches Abbott while her dad Nobuo guides Japanese hope Takahiko Kozuka. "Working with Yuka she consults her father a lot. I do get his coaching indirectly," said 24-year-old Abbott. "I'm honoured to work with such a great family in figure skating." Nobuo Sato, along with his wife Kumiko, coached Yuka when she won the 1994 world title, a month after she finished fifth at the Lillehammer Olympics.Lebanese lawmaker Walid Jumblatt on Friday expressed the support "to the people and the leaders of Syria." The leader of the Progressive Socialist Party (PSP) said in a statement that "as the Israeli madness and continuous threats hit its peak, I tell Syria and the Syrian leadership that we are with you above all considerations." A round of verbal battle between Syria and Israel started when Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak was quoted by Jerusalem daily Ha'aretz as speaking to senior military officers on Monday that " in the absence of an agreement with Syria, we are liable to enter a belligerent clash with it that could reach the point of an all- out regional war." In response to Barak's warning, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al- Moallem said on Wednesday that "Israel should not test Syria's determination, Israel knows that war will move to the Israeli cities." Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman responded by warning the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Thursday that "if you declare war on Israel, you and your family will lose your reign," according to Ha'aretz. A Druze politician, Jumblatt was once a close ally of Syria, but became a critic of Syria after the former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri's assassination. However, Jumblatt said now he aims at re-building the PSP on the basis of "historic principles," which include leftist economic policies, Arab nationalism, resistance to Israel and good relations with Damascus.Prince Charles' wife has turned barmaid during a visit to the set of a British TV soap. Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, got behind the bar of the Rover's Return, the fictional pub on "Coronation Street." The duchess says she is a lifelong fan of the show, set in the fictional working-class community of Weatherfield. Camilla visited the set in Manchester, northwest England and watched the cast film a scene from the long-running soap. She said the show was "a wonderful British institution." Thursday's royal visit marked the 50th anniversary year of "Coronation Street," which began in 1960. Camilla says she would like to appear on the show. Her husband Charles, the heir to the British throne, had a walk-on part 10 years ago.Collated Spanish league results on Saturday: Sevilla 1 (Negredo 9) Almeria 0 Valladolid 0 Barcelona 3 (Xavi 20, Alves 22, Messi 56) Deportivo La Coruna 3 (Filipe Luis 49, Juca 59, Alvarez 89) Athletic Bilbao 1 (Colotto 79-og) Sunday - all 1600 GMT unless stated Sporting Gijon v Racing Santander, Tenerife v Valencia, Villarreal v Real Zaragoza, Xerez v Osasuna, Espanyol v Real Mallorca, Getafe v Atletico Madrid (1800 GMT), Real Madrid v Malaga (2000 GMT)The US economy shed 20,000 jobs in January, according to official data Friday that offered mixed signals about prospects for a sustainable economic recovery. The Labor Department report also showed the unemployment rate eased to 9.7 percent from 10.0 percent in December, based on a household survey that appeared to contradict the payrolls data, but reflected in part discouraged workers leaving the labor force. The nonfarm payrolls data, one of the best indicators of economic momentum, fell short of expectations for a gain of 15,000 jobs that would have been a clear sign of a turnaround in the troubled labor market and overall economy. "This was a mediocre report," said Dana Johnson, chief economist at Comerica Bank. Still, Johnson said there were encouraging signs in the data including a rise in the workweek, increased income and more temporary workers hired. "I frankly was encouraged" by these elements, he said. "I would be surprised if we didn't see private-sector job growth in February and March that will show a sustainable expansion. It's just not visible yet." Wells Fargo economist Eugenio Aleman said the significant drop in the unemployment rate, which was better than expected, is a positive factor. "It's a very strong drop," Aleman said. "It's good news but I don't know if it is sustainable." Aleman said that although the figures reflected little change in the number of people working, the drop in the jobless rate "is good for the psychological aspect of the recovery." "This can improve consumer confidence, and maybe allow consumers to spend more" to boost overall economic activity. The White House said the report was encouraging but shows many Americans are still struggling to find employment. "While unemployment remains a severe problem, today's employment report contains encouraging signs of gradual labor market healing," said White House economic adviser Christina Romer. Romer said "the unemployment rate remains unacceptably high," and noted that the actual number of unemployed Americans had risen slightly. The January report showed a loss of 60,000 jobs in the goods-producing sector -- a hefty decline of 75,000 construction jobs offset a gain of 11,000 in manufacturing and 4,000 in mining. The services sectors added 48,000 jobs including 42,000 in retail and 44,000 in financial activities that offset losses in other segments. The report showed the average workweek, sometimes seen as a proxy for economic activity, rose slightly to 33.3 hours from 33.2 hours. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3 percent. "The January employment report brings moderately good news," said Sophia Koropeckyj at Moody's Economy.com. "Unemployment is likely close to bottoming out but there is little in the report that employment will rebound strongly soon." The figures included a revision of 2009 data, which showed about 600,000 more job losses than previously estimated. The revisions showed a loss of more than 4.8 million jobs in the year and 8.4 million since the recession began in December 2007. For December, the data was revised to show a steep drop of 150,000 jobs instead of the 85,000 previously estimated. But November data was revised to show a gain of 64,000 jobs instead of a rise of 4,000. Official figures last week showed the US economy roared back to life with a 5.7 percent growth pace in the fourth quarter, led by brisk business spending that offset sluggish consumer activity. The report on gross domestic product (GDP) showed the strongest growth in six years, but economists say the figure was boosted by special factors such as inventory restocking and may not be sustained unless employment picks up. The economy has shown growth in the past two quarters after four quarters of contraction and the worst recession in decades. But an economic panel recognized as the arbiter of business cycles has not declared an end to the recession, based on its criteria.If you repeat something often enough, it becomes conventional wisdom. Republicans insist they are not simply the Party of No. They are the Party of Plans, which they press with gusto upon anyone who will pay attention. Walk slowly through the halls of the Capitol and you'll have a Republican come up and whisper a bullet point in your ear, a little like the saleswoman who waylays you with a spritz of perfume at Bloomingdale's. At presidential addresses, Republicans hold up sheets of paper with their plans. At House Republicans' session with President Barack Obama last week at their retreat in Baltimore, every other question was about their unappreciated plans. To their surprise, Obama recited some of their so-called plans back to them, such a disturbing turn of events that Fox News cut away to resume its regularly scheduled programming. Obama observed that the plans fall well short of action items. You can't just wish something into being, like the heading in their "No-Cost Jobs Plan" that reads, "Tear Down Self-Imposed Obstacles to Economic Growth." In other words: clear-cut pesky regulations about mine safety and meat packing. We might die, but we'll be more competitive. Or let's look at "The Rapid Economic Recovery Plan" pressed by House Minority Leader John Boehner at the start of Obama's term. Boehner touted it as cheaper, simpler, and easier than the president's stimulus plan. It's certainly simple, full of bromides that would be at home on a needlepoint pillow. With no specifics or legislative language, it offered points including, "Halt Any Proposed Rule or Regulation Expected to Have an Economic Cost," "Keep American Jobs at Home," "Give Working Families Tax Relief," "Rebuild 401(k)s and Spur Investment Through a Zero Capital Gains Tax." This is a plan like my plan to get a house on the beach. Every spring, at the first hint of warm weather to come, I tell my daughter about my plan. "What a great idea," she says. It's how we celebrate the arrival of spring. Like me, the Republicans have ideas with few details, no course of action, no way to pay for what they propose. Lower taxes and fewer regulations were the mantra of the Bush years, which saw economic dips and downturns culminating in the financial meltdown of 2008, plus a $1.3 trillion deficit. Because their stimulus plan didn't get the respect it deserved, Republicans voted en masse against the one that was translated into legislation through the sausage grinder of committee hearings and floor debate. When that $787 billion bill passed a year ago, Republicans trashed it, not just refusing to acknowledge that it averted a depression but claiming it hadn't saved or created one job. Boehner, in particular, claimed there hadn't been any projects in his home state of Ohio -- until his hometown newspaper uncovered $52 million. Embarrassingly, a Republican sheriff from Boehner's own district went on CNN to declare his gratitude: "The stimulus is working for me here in Butler County because I am keeping my deputies and I am not having to lay them off." At the Baltimore Q&A, with some dramatic flair, Republicans presented Obama with all their various proposals combined in a booklet designed to show they weren't the "party of opposition" but the party of "Better Solutions." Problem is, the Better Solutions aren't. Rather, the booklet is a smorgasbord of more broad, diffuse language that can't be analyzed by experts, work as advertised or translate into legislation. The financial reform plan is one the banks love. It does not reform much of anything. Five of the 13 items were already in the GOP health-care alternative, previously considered by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The CBO, which Republicans swear by, said this Republican alternative would have helped only 3 million people secure coverage and cut costs by only $68 billion over 10 years. The Democratic bill, flyspecked by multiple committees and a flock of analysts and experts, covers 36 million more people, trims the uninsured population to 4 percent of Americans and narrows the deficit by $104 billion. The Republicans proposed a budget, meantime, that relies on yet more tax cuts, including eliminating for good the expired estate tax. Republicans under Bush reached tax nirvana by gradually phasing out the estate tax to the point where, last month, it reached zero. Without action, it reverts to pre-Bush levels in 2011, though Democrats will likely resurrect it this year. Ferocious tax-cutters though they be, even Republicans are likely to make any reinstatement retroactive, lest government incentivize pulling the plug on people while the tax is off. A year ago Obama promised to reach out to Republicans. He had a huge majority but wanted to govern across the aisle, as he said in his visit to the lion's den last week. He had them over to the White House for our secular sacrament of watching the Super Bowl. He followed up with small cocktail parties. One of his rare nights out was to dinner with conservative columnists at George Will's house. He appointed Republicans to his cabinet and gave Republican senators a chance to put forward their proposals in the health- care bill by way of the so-called Gang of Six. Many of their concerns were accommodated, resulting in a bill so ugly in places even proponents have to hold their noses. Yet Democrats got not one Republican vote for their trouble. When Obama was elected, Republicans wondered if it would be the end of them. If anything, they should thank the president for their resuscitation by making them so relevant in his quest for bipartisanship. We'll know soon if he's going to keep trying. The Super Bowl is just three days away. Margaret Carlson, author of "Anyone Can Grow Up: How George Bush and I Made It to the White House" and former White House correspondent for Time magazine, is a Bloomberg News columnist.Results from the third day of the ATP Movistar Open here on Wednesday (x denotes seeding): 2nd rd: Joao Souza (BRA) bt Pere Riba (ESP) 6-4, 6-4 Alberto Martin (ESP) bt Ricardo Mello (BRA) 6-3, 6-4Pakistan said Thursday it could play an important role in promoting reconciliation in Afghanistan and was willing to assist Afghan-led peace efforts after an eight-year Taliban insurgency. Afghan President Hamid Karzai won backing for a new peace and reconciliation programme with the Taliban at a conference in London last month aimed at establishing a road map for the war-torn country. "We fully agree that reconciliation and reintegration in Afghanistan is an important element to achieve peace and stability in the country," Pakistani foreign ministry spokesman Abdul Basit told reporters. "We genuinely believe Pakistan can be helpful in this process. We would like the government of Afghanistan to see how they would like to lead this process. It is also for Afghanistan to determine what role other countries can play. "Pakistan is ready to help in whatever way it is asked for.... Pakistan can play an important role in promoting genuine reconciliation," he added. Many Afghans believe Pakistan's powerful military are sponsoring the Taliban, preparing for the day US troops leave so that Islamabad can exercise influence over a Taliban government, offsetting rival power India. "We already have serious concerns about India for using Afghanistan (soil) to destabilise Pakistan," said Basit. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates all recognised Afghanistan's 1996-2001 Taliban government, which was toppled by US-led forces after the September 11 attacks. Karzai met Saudi King Abdullah this week in what was thought to be an effort to get Saudi Arabia to coax Taliban leaders into reconciliation talks. Pakistan's army chief said Monday that his country had no interest in "controlling" Afghanistan, in a robust defence of Islamabad's policy across the border and its fight against Islamist extremists. General Ashfaq Kayani, a former director of Inter-Services Intelligence, the spy agency at the heart of US fears that Islamabad is playing a double game, said peace in Afghanistan was crucial to Pakistan's long-term interests. Kayani even offered Pakistani help in training Afghan security forces, key to Washington's exit strategy from the war in Afghanistan.South Carolina first lady Jenny Sanford writes in her new book that she got short of breath and later felt unwanted and ugly when she found out about her husband's affair with an Argentine woman. The New York Daily News reported on its Web site Monday that Sanford also writes that one of her sons exclaimed that it's "worse than Eliot Spitzer" when she told them about Gov. Mark Sanford's infidelity. Spitzer is the former New York governor who resigned after acknowledging he was a client of a call-girl ring. Jenny Sanford's memoir "Staying True," published by Ballantine Books, an imprint of Random House Inc., goes on sale Friday. She will be interviewed by Barbara Walters on ABC's 20/20 on Thursday night. A segment of the interview aired last month, a few days before she filed for divorce from her husband of more than 20 years. The divorce will be final later this month. Mark Sanford disappeared from the state for five days last summer, and his staff told reporters he was hiking on the Appalachian Trail. But he was really in Argentina seeing his mistress, Maria Belen Chapur, during a trip that was supposed to be an economic development mission. Mark Sanford, who later called the other woman his "soul mate" in an interview with The Associated Press, publicly confessed to the affair during a Statehouse news conference upon his return. Jenny Sanford told the AP at the time that she discovered the affair in January 2009 when she found a copy of a letter her husband wrote to Chapur. She said in the ensuing months he asked several times for permission to visit his mistress. Jenny Sanford, a Georgetown-educated, former Wall Street vice president, moved out of the Governors Mansion last summer and is living with the couple's four sons at their beach house on Sullivans Island. Mark Sanford's office declined to comment Monday.A think-tank linked to President Dmitry Medvedev on Wednesday proposed radical changes in Russia that would see the country with a thriving multi-party democracy, joining NATO and considering EU membership. The report by The Institute of Contemporary Development (INSOR) said Russia was at a crossroads in its history where it faced a choice between becoming a modern country or losing its status as a great power. Entitled "21st Century Russia: the Image of the Tomorrow We Want", the report has been keenly anticipated for disclosing the vision of the modernizing figures seen as close to Medvedev. INSOR was set up by Medvedev after taking power in 2008 to advise on economic policy and is seen as a key pillar of his vow to modernize Russia's economic and political system. Medvedev has made modernization and innovation his mantras over the last months. But sceptics argue his ambitions carry little weight given the real power in the country is still wielded by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. "Russia's leaders have to make a choice on how we see our country in the future and what we are going to work for so we do not miss a unique historic chance," the report said. Igor Yurgens, head of the institute, told reporters there was "great hope" that Medvedev was the right man to implement the changes. But on Putin he was more cautious. "The role of Vladimir Putin will be what he sees for himself. This is a man who has earned a worthy place in the history of Russia. His popularity allows him to take any kind of decision. We count on his common sense," Yurgens said. Whereas Russian politics is now dominated by the ruling party United Russia, the report said Russia should have a multi-party system where the lower house is elected half according to party lists and half on a regional basis. Regional governors should be elected by direct suffrage, as was the case under the presidency of Boris Yeltsin before Putin changed the law to presidential appointment followed by approval by the regional parliament. On foreign policy, Russia should become a member of a reformed NATO organization, while the "prospects for full membership of the European Union should be considered." The Russian military -- still heavily reliant on young conscripts -- should become an entirely voluntary force of around half a million people. Helped by high oil prices, Russia enjoyed political and economic stability under Putin's 2000-2008 presidency unprecedented in its post-Soviet history. But the economic crisis hit Russia hard, exposing its failure to diversify its hydrocarbon-dependent economy and raising concern amongst the authorities of an upsurge of social unrest. At the weekend thousands of people demonstrated in Russia's western exclave of Kaliningrad, in the biggest protest since the economic crisis began, with some of the protesters calling for Putin to step down.Sudan will be the first to lead a joint Chadian-Sudanese border force, delegations told AFP on Friday following talks in Khartoum. "The two parties have agreed that for the first six months, the Sudanese side will lead the joint force," according to a document signed by Chadian secretary of state for defence Mahamat Beshir Okoromi and General Mohammed Atta al-Moula, Sudan's head of intelligence. "The general staff of the joint force, which will be led by a Sudanese and deputised by a Chadian for the first six months, will have its headquarters in El-Geneina," capital of West Darfur, some 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the Chad border, a Chadian official told AFP. "On February 18, the commanders of the joint force of the two countries will meet in El-Geneina" to "get acquainted with observation posts and determine the practicalities of the deployment of the force until February 25," the document said. An agreement was signed last month to normalise relations between both countries. Under the deal, a joint force will be deployed on their border, which effectively means that Chad would have to stop supporting Darfur rebels and Sudan would cease backing Chadian rebels. A meeting is scheduled between legal teams from both countries on February 8 in Ndjamena to carve out the joint force's rules of engagement. "We have already prepared our troops and our equipment. We have named our officials and are waiting for word of deployment from the top," a Sudanese diplomat told AFP. The force should be made up of 3,000 men, with Sudan and Chad each providing 1,500, the diplomat said. According to verbal agreements at the talks, "in case of need the joint border force can solicit the intervention of troops and security forces of the country where it is deployed." "We have decided to finish with the so-called Sudan-Chad conflict," said Okoromi, adding that "upon our return, we will put everything in place to implement the agreement." Chadian President Idriss Deby Itno said last week that he will travel to Khartoum on Monday for talks with President Omar al-Beshir. A large Chadian delegation arrived in the Sudanese capital on Friday to prepare for Deby's arrival, an AFP reporter said. Chad has long accused Sudan of supporting rebels seeking to oust the government, while Khartoum has charged Ndjamena with backing ethnic minority rebels in the conflict-torn western Sudanese region of Darfur.Pakistan said Thursday it could play an important role in promoting reconciliation in Afghanistan and was willing to assist Afghan-led peace efforts after an eight-year Taliban insurgency. Afghan President Hamid Karzai won backing for a new peace and reconciliation programme with the Taliban at a conference in London last month aimed at establishing a road map for the war-torn country.

The company said in a statement posted on the Kuwait Stock Exchange website that its board of directors will meet on Sunday to study the offer, also without revealing its value. The KSE immediately suspended trading in the shares of its largest listed firm until it receives notification of the outcome of the meeting. Kuwait's Al-Rai newspaper reported on Saturday that India's largest mobile operator Bharti Airtel has offered 10.7 billion dollars to buy Zain's African units, except in Sudan. Zain also said the deal does not include Morocco. Zain entered the African market in 2005, buying the assets of Dutch Celtel for 3.5 billion dollars. Later, Zain made key acquisitions in several other African nations, including Nigeria. Zain also operates in Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia as well as Kuwait. Zain's share price rose more than 20 percent and its capitalisation gained three billion dollars to 16.1 billion dollars over the sale reports. Last summer, Zain declined an offer from French telecom and media group Vivendi, reportedly at between 10 billion and 11 billion dollars, saying the price was below expectation. Earlier this month, Zain accepted the resignation of Saad al-Barrak as its CEO. On Thursday, it appointed former communications minister Nabil bin Salama to replace him. Since joining the company in 2002, Barrak transformed Zain from a local company with less than one million subscribers to an international telecom firm operating in 23 nations with 72 million subscribers. The process required massive investments that exceeded 12 billion dollars.French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said Tuesday that increased pressure should be put on Israelis and Palestinians to restart the stalled peace process in the region. Addressing a regular dinner meeting with high-ranking international envoys on Palestinian development, he said such pressure is necessary for their respective development and bilateral relations. The envoys were taking stock of the 2007 international commitments for a 7.7-billion U.S. dollar aid fund for Palestinians over three years. As the pledges are running out this year, Kouchner promised to continue supporting the development program under the current Palestinian government. "We have decided to meet every two months," Kouchner told a subsequent press conference Tuesday night. Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, Egyptian Foreign Minister Abul al- Gheit, EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton, former British prime minister Tony Blair and Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere attended the meeting. In a press release issued before the regular follow-up meeting of the 2007 donor conference, the French Foreign Ministry said 5.5 billion dollars, or over 70 percent of the money promised over three years, had been raised to fulfill the 2007 pledge. The funds have enabled the Palestinian authorities to improve governance and set up a more transparent financial system, the ministry said. Also high on the agenda of the high-profile meeting was the situation in Gaza. Participants were expected to propose lifting the embargo over Gaza to allow the free flow of people and goods.Argentine President Cristina Kirchner on Wednesday named economist Mercedes Marco del Pont as the new head of the central bank, replacing the man she sacked over a clash about debt payments. Kirchner described Marco del Pont as a "very important official who has played a prominent role at the head of the Banco (de la) Nacion," Argentina's largest state-owned bank. She is replacing Martin Redrado, who was dismissed by Kirchner for his refusal to approve her plan to use some 6.6 billion dollars in reserves to pay off debt due this year. Kirchner's move to sack Redrado was backed late Tuesday by a legislative committee which reviewed his and Kirchner's actions in the row and sided with the president.Hamburg's Peruvian striker Paolo Guerrero says he will overcome his injury and fear of flying and be ready to play in the Bundesliga at the end of March. Guerrero told Kicker magazine's Thursday edition that he'd been working with two Hamburg physiotherapists and that his injured left knee is giving him no problems. Guerrero tore ligaments in his left knee and had surgery in September. "We are building up the muscles in the left knee. We've been working on the bike, I'd like to start running in the next few days," Guerrero said. "I have no pain. The knee shows no reaction, it's not swollen and it's stable. ... I am going to be the same Guerrero, maybe even stronger. I am optimistic, I think I am doing well. I will be making my comeback at the end of March." But Hamburg coach Bruno Labbadia said he didn't think such an early comeback would be possible, adding that the interview "took us all a little bit by surprise." "Paolo is a long way from playing, that's a false assessment," Labbadia said. Labbadia said it was "a pity" that Guerrero brought up the subject of his fear of flying. "We tried to take the pressure off him, but he's brought it back in," the coach said. The striker missed four flights back to Germany because of his fear of flying. Guerrero told Kicker one of the flights returned to Lima because he was suffering from severe stomach problems brought on by gastritis, a result of his phobia. "I have fear of flying but I also have fear that something could happen with my stomach in the plane," Guerrero told Kicker. "First I want to be fit and then I will fly to Germany. I will fly, no problem. I also want to get rid of this gastritis, my mother is cooking special food for me. I am glad that Hamburg's management has shown so much understanding." Guerrero said he would be flying with the team again and that he wanted to extend his contract with Hamburg that expires at the end of the season. To compensate for Guerrero's absence, Hamburg has signed Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who still hasn't played in the wake of knee and calf injuries. Guerrero said there would be a "healthy competition" between himself and van Nistelrooy for a place in Hamburg's attack.Buoyed by the success of "Avatar," the science fiction blockbuster that has become the highest-grossing movie to date, the News Corp. reported a quarterly profit on Tuesday that surpassed the expectations of Wall Street analysts. But the financial success was reduced by the effect of a recent $500 million payment to settle three lawsuits against one of its lesser-known units, News America Marketing, which sells in-store advertising in supermarkets and publishes coupon inserts. "Avatar," made by James Cameron and released by News Corp.'s 20th Century Fox film studio, has generated nearly $600 million at the North American box office, and more than $2 billion worldwide, making it the highest grossing movie to date in dollars not adjusted for inflation. It surpassed "Titanic," another film from Cameron, that had topped the list of moneymakers. Because of the success of "Avatar," several Wall Street analysts raised their earnings estimates for the News Corp. in recent days. The News Corp. reported revenue of $8.68 billion in its fiscal second quarter, ended Dec. 31, up 10 percent from the quarter a year earlier. Excluding the effect of the $500 million settlement, the company reported operating income of $1.2 billion, up from $839 million a year earlier. The second-quarter net income was $254 million, or 10 cents a share, in contrast to a net loss of $6.4 billion, or $2.45 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. In a conference call with analysts, Rupert Murdoch, News Corp.'s chairman, described the company's performance as "extraordinary" given that "we've endured the most severe recession since the Great Depression." Adjusted second-quarter earnings were 25 cents a share. On average, Wall Street analysts had expected the company to earn 20 cents a share in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. In addition to its Hollywood studio, the News Corp. owns a wide range of media assets, including the Fox broadcast television network, Fox News Channel, satellite services in Britain and Asia, and several newspapers, including The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post. All four of the company's biggest businesses -- broadcast TV, cable TV, newspapers and movies -- reported increases in both revenue and operating income. At the company's newspaper unit, which is central to the company and close to Murdoch's heart, operating income increased from $200 million to $259 million. Revenue increased from $1.5 billion to $1.65 billion. The company attributed the profit gain to "increased advertising revenues at The Wall Street Journal and lower operating expenses throughout the newspaper businesses from prior year restructuring efforts," according to a company statement. The cable network division contributed the most to the company's overall profit, largely because of the success of Fox News, which has emerged as the growth engine of the News Corp. Operating income from the unit increased to $604 million, from $448 million. In film, the News Corp. reported an increase in operating income to $324 million, from $112 million. While "Avatar" certainly helped, the film will probably be a larger contributor in the third quarter. The film was released on Dec. 18, so it was only in theaters for 13 days during the quarter. "In the quarter we booked much of the film's costs but only a small portion of its receipts," Murdoch said. On the call, Murdoch defended the value of content, especially journalism, in the face of the Internet and new technologies, which have upended traditional media models. He said that new devices, like Apple's recently introduced iPad, and smartphones would be "empty vessels without any great content." "Content is not just king," Murdoch said, "it is the emperor of all things electronic."The nation's top two defense officials called Tuesday for an end to the 16-year-old "don't ask, don't tell" law, a major step toward allowing openly gay men and women to serve in the U.S. military for the first time in its history. "No matter how I look at the issue, I cannot escape being troubled by the fact that we have in place a policy which forces young men and women to lie about who they are in order to defend their fellow citizens," Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee. He said it was his personal belief that "allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly would be the right thing to do." But both Mullen and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates told the committee they needed more time to review how to carry out the change in policy, which requires an act of Congress, and predicted some disruption to the armed forces. Mullen is the first sitting chairman of the Joint Chiefs to support the repeal of the policy. In 1993, Gen. Colin L. Powell, the chairman at the time, opposed allowing gay men and lesbians to serve openly, but supported "don't ask, don't tell" as the compromise passed by Congress. Under the policy, gay men and lesbians may serve as long as they keep their sexual orientation secret. Pentagon officials said the review of the issue could take up to a year. In the interim, Gates announced that the military was moving toward enforcing the existing policy "in a fairer manner" -- a reference to the possibility that the Pentagon would no longer take action to discharge service members whose sexual orientation is revealed by third parties or jilted partners, one of the law's most onerous aspects. The committee's chairman, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., welcomed the abolition of the policy. Its ranking Republican, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, said that he was "deeply disappointed," and that the military's culture was so different from civilian life that the rules for its members must differ. Gates and Mullen were responding to President Barack Obama's campaign pledge to end "don't ask, don't tell," which Obama, after a year of saying little about it, reaffirmed in his State of the Union address last week. "We have received our orders from the commander in chief and we are moving out accordingly," Gates said."Germany Friday expressed its disappointment over the cancellation by India of a tender for multi-role tanker aircraft, reported the Indo-Asian News Service. The news report quoted German Ambassador to India Thomas Matussek as saying that the cancellation "came as a little bit of a nasty surprise" and "very disappointing that it was rejected at the political level". The ambassador also said the rejection was not explained in detail and it appears that quality, performance of the system, state of the technology, reliability were not the criteria for the decision for canceling the contract, as the selection was done only on the label price. India has canceled a tender to buy six mid-air refueling aircraft for fighter jets in which the European consortium EADS Airbus 330 MRTT was the top contender. German President Horst Koehler will pay a visit to India next week, during which he will meet Indian President Pratibha Patil, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and business leaders in Mumbai.Nearly 20 percent of detainees released from Guantanamo Bay are believed to have returned to the battlefield, the White House said in a letter to House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi seen by AFP Tuesday. The letter, from President Barack Obama's counterterrorism advisor John Brennan, acknowledges that the "intelligence community assesses that 20 percent of detainees transferred from Guantanamo are confirmed or suspected of recidivist activity." That 20 percent includes 9.6 percent of released detainees who are confirmed to have returned to militant activities and another 10.4 percent whom US intelligence "suspects, but is not certain, may have engaged in recidivist activities," Brennan wrote. Among detainees known to have returned to terrorism are some who joined Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a terror group based in Yemen that claimed responsibility for planning a failed Christmas Day terror attack on a US plane. Obama pledged in early January that he would not return released Guantanamo detainees to Yemen until the "unsettled situation" in the impoverished Arab nation had been resolved. Brennan's letter, first reported by ABC News, notes that all the known cases of former Guantanamo detainees joining terrorist groups involved prisoners released by former president George W. Bush's administration. There were "no confirmed or suspected recidivists among detainees transferred during this administration, although we recognize the ongoing risk that detainees could engage in such activity," his letter said. On January 10, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that dozens of former detainees held at Guantanamo, a third of them from Yemen, had returned to combat. The Obama administration has pledged to close the controversial detention facility for terror suspects located on a US naval base on Cuba's southern tip. But it missed an initial January closure deadline, and some 192 men are still detained at the facility.A federal judge has dismissed civil securities fraud charges against a New York brokerage firm and its executives that resulted from a probe into the Bernard Madoff case. The charges were dismissed Tuesday against Cohmad Securities Corp.; its chairman, Maurice "Sonny" Cohn; his daughter, chief operating officer Marcia Cohn; and vice president and broker Robert Jaffe. The Securities and Exchange Commission brought the charges last year. It said the defendants' fraudulent intent could be inferred from allegations that Madoff requested secrecy in marketing his investments and they complied. Judge Louis Stanton said Monday that the SEC's chain of inferences to accuse the defendants was "speculative and flimsy." Madoff is serving 150 years in prison after bilking thousands of investors of billions of dollars.England manager Fabio Capello alone will make a decision on John Terry's future as England captain, the Football Association (FA) said on Monday. The 29-year-old Chelsea defender's position has been called into question following reports the married father of twins had an affair with the ex- girlfriend of former team-mate Wayne Bridge. There are now concerns the issue could have a damaging effect on England's bid to win the World Cup in South Africa later this year but the FA were adamant they would leave the matter to Capello. "Fabio Capello alone will make the decision about John Terry's position," said an FA spokesman. "Fabio is fully up to speed with developments regarding John Terry. "He spoke with our chairman Lord (David) Triesman and chief executive Ian Watmore today (Monday), who both backed him to make the best decision for England on footballing grounds. "Fabio is dealing with the matter in his own way using his extensive experience as a football manager." Capello is due to return to England later this week and will travel to Warsaw for the Euro 2012 qualifying competition draw this weekend.A US-educated Pakistani woman who caught the attention of human rights groups after she disappeared for five years was found guilty Wednesday of trying to kill American servicemen in Afghanistan. Aafia Siddiqui, 37, a neuroscientist trained at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was found guilty on all charges by a jury in federal court. She faces up to life in prison. A family lawyer immediately announced an appeal, citing "prejudice and bias." Siddiqui was accused of grabbing a rifle at an Afghan police station where she was being interrogated in July 2008 and trying to gun down a group of US servicemen. Although she was not charged with terrorism, prosecutors described her as a would-be terrorist who had also plotted to bomb New York. Her lawyers tried to prove Siddiqui, who reported disturbing hallucinations involving her missing children, was insane. However, a judge ruled her fit to stand trial. Tina Monshipour, an attorney for Siddiqui's family, said afterwards: "This verdict is being subject to an appeal." "There were a lot of unfair decisions," Monshipour said. "She was portrayed as a terrorist even if there were no terrorism charges in this trial. This is one of those cases in which we see prejudice and bias invade the courtroom." Pakistan also immediately voiced criticism. "We are dismayed over the unexpected verdict of the jury in Dr Aafia Siddiqui's case," Pakistan's embassy in Washington said in a statement. "The government will do all that is needed to provide justice to her as a Pakistani citizen." Siddiqui, wearing a white veil, repeatedly disrupted her trial with outbursts at the jury, witnesses and her own lawyers, including claims that she was a victim of Israel. After being found guilty, she responded in similar fashion, saying: "This is a verdict from Israel, not America. The anger should be directed where it belongs." The trial has drawn widespread attention because it is one of a string of high- profile terrorism cases currently being handled by US prosecutors. Several other suspects in alleged bomb plots are working their way through the system, and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-described mastermind of the September 11, 2001 attacks, is also due to be tried -- possibly in New York. A frail-looking woman who excelled in her US studies, Siddiqui featured on a 2004 US list of people suspected of Al-Qaeda links. She is also said to have married a relative of Mohammed, although this has been disputed. Family and some human rights groups paint a different picture, claiming that Siddiqui was imprisoned by US forces after disappearing along with her three children in Pakistan in 2003 and that she is now mentally disturbed. All anyone agrees on is that Siddiqui was taken to an Afghan police station in the town of Ghazni in July 2008. Prosecutors claimed that Siddiqui was arrested in possession of notes indicating plans to attack the Statue of Liberty and other New York landmarks. Some in the US press have dubbed her "Lady Qaeda." However, no terrorism charges were filed after she was brought to the United States, making her trial an outwardly straightforward criminal case in which the jury had to decide whether she did or did not attempt to murder US officers. Prosecutors allege she picked up a rifle in the police station and opened fire on US servicemen and FBI representatives who had come to try and take her into detention. She missed and in a struggle was herself shot by one of the US soldiers. Defense lawyers argued there was no physical evidence, such as finger prints or gunpowder traces, to show Siddiqui even grabbed the rifle, let alone opened fire. But the trial did not shed light on the mystery surrounding this petite, academically brilliant mother of three. Human rights groups have long speculated that Siddiqui may have been secretly imprisoned and tortured at the US base in Bagram, Afghanistan, during the five years prior to the 2008 incident. The US military has denied she was ever held at the base. Siddiqui vanished in Pakistan at a time of intense efforts by US-backed local security forces to root out Al-Qaeda. Relatives believe she was grabbed in one of these operations. Siddiqui appeared to refer to the rumors during her trial, protesting during one of her outbursts: "If you were in a secret prison... (where) your children were tortured." Two of Siddiqui's children remain missing, one of them presumed dead. Her 13 -year-old son Mohammad Ahmed now lives with the family in Karachi.A parliamentary sports committee Wednesday summoned Pakistani security officials to explain a delay in the release of a report on last year's terror attack on Sri Lanka's cricket team in Lahore. A senior federal government official told the committee the government had yet to receive a report on the attacks from the provincial authorities. The report was compiled by a judicial commission in 2009 and was supposed to be submitted to the parliamentary committee by the Punjab government in September last year. "On numerous occasions we demanded a copy of the report but have not received any from the Punjab government," the official, Ismail Qureshi, told the committee. Parliamentary sports committee chief Jamshed Dasti said later the chief secretary of Punjab and the inspector general of its provincial police had been summoned to appear before his committee later this month. The Sri Lankan squad was on its way to a stadium in Lahore for the third day's play in the second Test on March 3 when terrorists opened fire and hurled grenades at their bus, injuring seven players and their assistant coach. The attacks forced Sri Lanka's government to recall the team, with Pakistan later stripped of its share of 2011 Cricket World Cup matches and losing any hope of hosting international teams for the foreseeable future. The committee also discussed the Pakistani teams poor performance in Australia last month and former captain Javed Miandads dispute with the Pakistan Cricket Board, officials said. Pakistan were blanked 3-0 in Tests and 5-0 in one-day series in their tour of Australia last year. They play their last match on the tour, a Twenty20, in Melbourne on Friday. Dasti, a vocal critic of PCB chairman Ijaz Butt, demanded that President Asif Ali Zardari, who is also patron of the board, remove the chairman. Zardari appointed Butt PCB chairman in October 2008.Al-Qaeda will attack the United States until Osama bin Laden and his second-in- command are "dead or captured," and is sure to try in the next three to six months, the top US spy chief said Tuesday. "The chances of an attempted attack are certain. They're going to try," US Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair replied when asked about the likelihood of an attempted al-Qaeda strike over that timeframe. Blair said the extremist network that carried out the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks would keep targeting the United States until bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri have been caught or killed. "We judge that al-Qaeda maintains its intent to attack the Homeland preferably with a largescale operation that would cause mass casualties, harm the US economy, or both," Blair told the Senate Intelligence Committee. "We assess that at least until Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri are dead or captured, al-Qaeda will retain its resolute intent to strike the Homeland," he said. With President Barack Obama's administration under fire for its handling of the attempted Christmas Day bomber, notably informing him of his right to remain silent, Blair declined to say whether bin Laden should get the same treatment if captured. Instead, Blair said he "would very much hope" that the Saudi-born extremists would be interrogated and that officials would "squeeze" him for information.Leinster flanker Kevin McLaughlin will make his debut for Ireland in the first match of its Six Nations defense against Italy on Saturday. McLaughlin will line up with David Wallace and Jamie Heaslip, while all-time leading scorer Ronan O'Gara will play at No. 10 ahead of Jonathan Sexton.Rightback Matthieu Chalme has extended his contract with Bordeaux for two more years. The 29-year-old defender will stay with the French champions through June 2014, his club said on Tuesday. Chalme, who has been nurtured by Bordeaux, is the sixth player to recently extend his contract with the club, beside Carlos Henrique, David Bellion, Lamine Sane, Fernando Menegazzo and Jussie.The Grammy winners are all set to perform during the NBA All-Star game on Feb. 14. Shakira will perform two songs from her latest CD, "She Wolf"; Keys will perform new and old hits. The divas will go on during the halftime show. Usher will sing a new song, the dance jam "More," during the introductions of the National Basketball Association all-stars. The tune is from his upcoming album, "Raymond v. Raymond." The game, which will take place at the Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, will go on before the largest crowd ever to attend a basketball game, according to a statement from the NBA. ------ On the Net: http://www.nba.com/Brazilian midfielders Fernando Menegazzo and Jussie have extended their current deals with French league champions Bordeaux, the club said on Tuesday. Fernando had been courted by several Italian clubs, including Genoa, during the close season, but he has negotiated a three-year extension and will now stay in south-west France until 2014. Jussie, formerly of Cruzeiro and Japanese side Kashiwa Reysol, agreed a four- year extension that will see him stay with Laurent Blanc's side until 2015.Chelsea's hopes of opening up a four-point lead at the top of the Premier League were dashed on Tuesday when Carlo Ancelotti's side were held to a 1-1 draw at Hull. Relegation-threatened Hull stunned the leaders by taking a 29th-minute lead when Stephen Mouyokolo powered home from a corner. Didier Drogba, making his first appearance since his return from the African Nations Cup, equalised with a free-kick three minutes before half-time for his eighth goal in his last nine matches for the club. However, Chelsea were unable to convert their second-half pressure into a winner. The draw leaves Chelsea two points clear of Manchester United and six clear of third-placed Arsenal, who visit Stamford Bridge on Sunday.Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders have made "significant progress" in their intensive talks as international community increasingly pushes the two sides for a solution to the decades-old Cyprus problem. "The leaders want me, on their behalf, to say that significant progress has been made in a series of areas of governance," said Alexander Downer, Special Adviser of the U.N. Secretary-General, after the two leaders rounded up on Friday their two rounds of intensive talks on governance and power sharing. Cyprus President Demetris Christofias, a Greek Cypriot, and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat have been engaged in talks for over 16 months trying to reach an agreement which will reunify the island. In order to inject new momentum to the peace process, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has decided to visit the divided island between January 31 and February 2. Downer added that Christofias and Talat had left the meeting "feeling positive", but the U.N. envoy declined to elaborate. Ban Ki-moon plans to meet the two leaders on Monday and hold a joint press conference in the U.N. controlled buffer zone. Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi will also start an official visit to the island this weekend. Cyprus' Foreign Minister Marcos Kyprianou has already discussed the Cyprus issue with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of a conference on Afghanistan in London. Recently, the U.S. government has expressed the intention to appoint a presidential envoy on the Cyprus problem. Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey militarily intervened and occupied the north of the island following a coup by a group of Greek officers. In 1983, the Turkish Cypriot authorities declared breakaway and set up the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", which is recognized only by Turkey. For several decades, the U.N. has continuously worked to persuade the two communities to find a viable solution to the Cyprus issue.More than 20 years ago, a young legislator proposed that no candidate for governor should take more than $2,500 per year in campaign contributions from a single donor. That legislator was Rick Perry. Yes, that one -- your Rick Perry and my Rick Perry -- the one who, shortly after proposing that law (spoiler alert: It didn't pass), began a string of electoral victories that has made him the longest-serving governor Texas has ever known. In the process, Perry decided that contribution limits impede free speech, and he no longer supports them. Texas, unlike most other states, does not limit how much money someone may give a candidate. Critics say that free-for-all gives Texas candidates little incentive to reach out to as many donors as possible. An Austin American-Statesman analysis of fund-raising records shows that the two leading Republican candidates for governor have reaped the benefits of the state's limitless system. Four out of every five dollars that Perry raised from individual donors last year came from those who gave more than $2,400, which is the maximum amount that a donor can give a candidate for federal office. The ratio was similar -- three out of every four dollars -- for U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, his chief rival for the GOP gubernatorial nod. Democrat Bill White was running for the U.S. Senate for most of 2009, so he had to comply with the federal limits. But in four weeks of fund raising for his gubernatorial campaign, almost 90 percent of White's dollars from individuals came from those who gave more than $2,400. There is something to be said for the simplicity of the Texas system. Federal campaigns work around the contribution limits by steering large donors to parties and outside groups. That happens some here in Texas, too, but for the most part, the money is easier to track. The problem is that most Texans don't have the time to track it, and they may or may not pay attention to those of us who do. We can all agree that campaigns cost money and that citizens should be allowed to support the candidates of their choice, but it's important to remember how politicians collect that money. They certainly won't forget. Those who give the most often get the most access. Tickets to a Hutchison fund raiser in Houston on Friday start at $1,000. But those who give at least $5,000 will get to take part in a round-table discussion with the senator. And when Perry fund raiser Jim Lee invited donors via fax to a strategy meeting with the governor, he told them it would "be limited to a small group of Houston's top business leaders. Thus, you will have plenty of time to have meaningful interaction with the Governor to discuss any topics of your concern." Lee asked participants to donate $7,500 to Perry's campaign. You have to wonder how many Texans who can't afford to give politicians thousands of dollars will get that kind of face time this year. Jason Embry writes for the Austin American-Statesman.

The coach declared that Robinho will begin the seventh round of the Sao Paulo state championship on the reserve bench. "I think it is a little premature for him to play the whole 90 minutes. No one is trying to hide the fact that his title as a starting player is only a question of time. Robinho is still adapting to the team and the city's climate. After speaking to him, he says that he is conscious of this and will be patient," described Dorival Junior. Robinho will wear jersey No. 7 in Sunday's highly anticipated game. Sao Paulo was also active in the negotiations with his former team, Manchester City. However, Santos won the bidding war and now will hope to use their newest weapon against their inner- state rival. Robinho returns to Santos after a five-year absence. He played for the costal city club during 2002-2005. Over that stretch, he played in 189 games, scoring 83 goals. He is the club's fifth- highest scorer, trailing only the great names of Pele, Serginho Chulapa and Juari.Beleaguered wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal has been dropped from the Pakistan squad for two Twenty20 internationals against England in Dubai later this month. Akmal came under severe criticism for his poor performance in recent test series against Australia. Sarfraz Ahmed, who replaced Akmal for the third test in Australia, but did not feature in either five one-day internationals or the T20 game, was named as Pakistan wicketkeeper Monday. Pakistan's regular Twenty20 captain, Shahid Afridi, will miss the first game in Dubai after he was banned for two matches for ball tampering during the fifth one-day international against Australia. Shoaib Malik, who led Pakistan in the only T21 game against Australia, was retained as captain for the short series against England.Japan and South Korea's domestic players will have a chance to push their World Cup selection hopes when the East Asian Championship begins here Saturday. The Feb. 6-14 tournament is a chance for Japan coach Takeshi Okada and South Korean coach Huh Jung-moo to decide which domestic-based players will make their respective squads in South Africa for the World Cup finals. China and Hong Kong are the other two competing nations. "The tournament is a chance for the players to take their game up another level," Okada said on the Japan Football Association Web site. "We'll make an assessment after the first two games against China and Hong Kong and have our best team for South Korea." Japan has been drawn in Group E against Cameroon, Denmark and the Netherlands at the World Cup finals while the Koreans are in Group B with Argentina, Nigeria and Greece. Okada will be especially eager to see if Kashima Antlers midfielder Mitsuo Ogasawara can contribute after a long international absence. Ogasawara had Japan's best scoring chance in a 0-0 draw with Venezuela on Tuesday and drew praise from Okada for his aggressiveness. Sota Hirayama, who came on in the second half and had several good chances against the South Americans, will also be looking to impress Okada. Japan opens the tournament on Saturday against China, and will then play Hong Kong but the real test for Okada's side will be Feb. 14 when they face the Koreans. South Korea is coming off a trip to South Africa and Spain where they lost to Zambia before wins over Finland and Latvia. During training overseas, Huh tried out several players, including Lee Dong-gook and No Byung-jun, in a forward role but the results were inconclusive. Lee was the 2009 K-League top scorer but has struggled to find his scoring touch with the national team. South Korea's opening game on Sunday is against Hong Kong. China coach Gao Hongbo will be hoping a strong performance in Tokyo will reinvigorate a side which seems to have fallen further behind Japan and South Korea. Hong Kong qualified for the tournament by finishing first in a competition in Taiwan last year. South Korea won the tournament the previous time it was played in 2008.The World Economic Forum is turning toward earthquake-ravaged Haiti and steering Africa to prosperity as more world leaders arrive for the annual event in this Swiss Alpine resort. Former President Bill Clinton will urge the 2,500 attendees on Thursday to invest in Haiti. South African President Jacob Zuma will focus on keeping the effects of the global financial crisis at bay. In a nod to the global economy, South Korean President Lee Myung-Bak, will address the critical issues facing the Group of 20, a preview of sorts well ahead of the November summit that his country his hosting, the first Asian country to do so. The G-20 is an international body that meets to discuss economic issues.Andy Murray failed to overcome Roger Federer and win Britain's first men's Grand Slam title in 74 years, but he earned the applause of the Australian media Monday for his fight against the Swiss master. Amid soaring expectations from the British public, Murray lost Sunday's final in straight sets but his journey to centre court has revived hopes that Britain can finally end its long drought. "Given the manner in which Murray fought for his life in an epic third-set tiebreaker -- the longest in the tournament's history -- a breakthrough win in a major mightn't be far away for the 22-year-old," the Daily Telegraph said. Murray himself said he put up a better fight against the brilliant Federer, who took his 16th Grand Slam title, than in their previous Grand Slam encounter in the final of the 2008 US Open. "Obviously I'm getting closer," the Scot told a post-match press conference after breaking down in tears during the trophy presentation. "I mean, my results in the Grand Slams would show that." "So far it's not been good enough, but I'm sure one day it will be." The Australian newspaper said while fifth-seeded Murray's second Grand Slam final ended the same way as his first, he was up against the greatest champion in the sport's history.
