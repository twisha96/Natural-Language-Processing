Parliament Does Not Support Amendment <unk> Tymoshenko
Today , the Ukraine parliament <unk> , within the Code of Criminal Procedure amendment , the motion to <unk> an article based on which the opposition leader , <unk> Tymoshenko , was sentenced .
The amendment that would lead to <unk> the <unk> former Prime Minister was <unk> during second reading of the proposal for <unk> of sentences for economic <unk> .
In October , Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for entering into what was reported to be a <unk> gas deal with Russia .
The <unk> is not yet <unk> the court will hear Tymoshenko &apos;s appeal in December .
Tymoshenko claims the <unk> is a political <unk> of the <unk> in the West , the trial has also <unk> suspicion of being <unk> .
The proposal to remove Article <unk> from the Code of Criminal Procedure , upon which the former Prime Minister was sentenced , was supported by <unk> members of parliament .
Its ratification would require <unk> votes .
Libya &apos;s <unk>
The story of Libya &apos;s <unk> , or <unk> , already has its <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> at an unknown place in the desert . Without him , the war is over .
It is time to define the winners .
As a rule , <unk> win in the <unk> the question is whether they are the moderate or the radical ones .
The transitional cabinet declared itself a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> law , of which we have already heard .
Libya will become a crime free country , as the punishment for <unk> is having one &apos;s hand <unk> .
Women can forget about <unk> potential religious <unk> will be <unk> etc .
Instead of a <unk> , a society <unk> of <unk> <unk> will be united by <unk> .
Libya will be in an order we cannot imagine and surely would not ask for .
However , our lifestyle is neither unique nor the best one and would not , most probably , be suitable for , for example , the people of Libya .
In fact , it is a wonder that the Islamic <unk> accepted help from the <unk> .
Their only <unk> is that from their point of view , NATO <unk> were not controlled by an American general , but Allah , the <unk> of whom they <unk> with each strike .
When winners are sought for in Libya , the West is not on the list .
We participated in a shooting , served Islam , and our politicians got rid of a <unk> , their political <unk> , without any guarantee of profit .
Given the recent bad experience from Afghanistan and Iraq , we decided against military occupation of Libya .
The <unk> thus do not have to worry about <unk> of the &quot; <unk> . &quot;
Without the occupation , will the oil companies get Libya &apos;s black gold for next to nothing , though ?
It is quite likely that they will not . The West will then finally be able to <unk> about its <unk> protection of human rights .
Unless the <unk> of the <unk> law put a stop to that .
New <unk> of <unk> <unk>
France and the rest of Europe are now in the investors &quot; <unk> .
A statistical <unk> <unk> over Europe on Tuesday .
<unk> countries released their <unk> GDP data .
Between quarters , the Czech economy <unk> Germany and France are growing .
Yet the <unk> market is <unk> records today .
<unk> are no longer looking at only <unk> they now focus on Spain , France , Austria , and others .
Eurozone statistical offices in Germany , Czech Republic , and some other countries , released their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter .
Germany &apos;s GDP has grown by the expected <unk> and France &apos;s by <unk> .
Both countries also adjusted their second quarter data , where Germany did better than expected <unk> <unk> increase instead of the original <unk> France reported a <unk> decrease , by <unk> (the original information suggested <unk>
In this year &apos;s third quarter , the Czech economy showed an interim increase of <unk> .
Between the quarters though , the GDP <unk> . According to the Czech <unk> Office , this confirmed the trend of a <unk> <unk> of economic growth .
The results are worse than estimates by <unk> .
<unk> <unk>
In this year &apos;s third quarter , Czech economy showed an interim increase of <unk> however , it <unk> between the quarters .
Based on preliminary and <unk> data , in the third quarter , the German economy grew by <unk> .
Between July and September , the economy of both the Eurozone and the European Union grew , compared to the previous quarter , by <unk> , which <unk> with estimates by <unk> .
The Greek economy showed an interim decrease of <unk> .
The <unk> on its <unk> bonds are <unk> .
<unk> of both Italian and Spanish bonds are growing towards critical limits .
Even Austria , Netherlands , France , and Belgium , etc. are beginning to experience problems .
Despite the fact that the situation in the region is getting worse , <unk> of Czech 1 - year bonds stay under <unk> .
<unk> are coming from Germany , <unk> that ECB be the last resort <unk> .
Czechs qualified for EURO .
In Montenegro they won 1: 0 and <unk> a 200 million <unk> .
Football representation successfully managed the <unk> task of the season !
Thanks to both the great Čech and beautiful goal of Petr <unk> , they won 1: 0 .
In the second half , Czech football was lucky to maintain its luxury lead from the home return match , and will again feature at the European Championship .
<unk> <unk> the progress match in a detailed report .
<unk> no <unk> in the first half , and a great portion of luck in the other .
Czech representation team , partially due to the home team &apos;s failure in the <unk> the great <unk> and <unk> <unk> won 1: 0 in Montenegro , and <unk> moving on to the European Championship .
<unk> Czech team defence only allowed the Montenegro team to <unk> in the second half .
Damjanovic and <unk> became the match &apos;s least lucky couple after losing two great opportunities .
The wonderful Petr Čech is one of the reasons the Czech representation team will not miss the next year &apos;s European Championship . And Czech football will thus gain nearly 200 million Czech <unk> .
From the opening minutes , the game was very <unk> .
Both teams found it difficult to join in the <unk> the game remained around the <unk> line most of the time .
That was also why there was no pressure from the home team in the first half . <unk> <unk> behind the defence were <unk> <unk> by the Czech defence .
Iranian Students Are <unk> to Die for Their Country &apos;s <unk> <unk>
They created a live <unk> .
Several hundred university students created a live chain around the nuclear power plant in Iran .
The <unk> is to express their support of their country &apos;s nuclear program against a possible Israel attack .
At Tuesday noon , students &apos; <unk> in front of the building were followed by their <unk> of death to both the USA and Israel .
In Isfahan , Iran , several hundred university students created a live chain around Isfahan <unk> <unk> Facility .
This way , they express their readiness to protect their country &apos;s nuclear program with their own lives .
In its recent report , the International <unk> Energy Agency <unk> stated that everything leads to the conclusion that Iran has not stopped striving for a nuclear weapon .
<unk> attack on Iran nuclear facilities has been discussed in Israel .
At Tuesday noon , students &apos; <unk> in front of the entrance into Isfahan <unk> <unk> Facility were followed by their <unk> of death to both the USA and Israel .
In case of an attack , aimed at the highest possible <unk> of the Iranian nuclear program , the targets would be , based on Israel press , the facilities in both Isfahan and <unk> , where the <unk> is being <unk> .
An <unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> No breakfast and <unk> for dinner
Over a third of children between 9 and 13 are <unk> while 9% of <unk> are overweight , 5% are obese .
As a recent research shows , obese children usually come from families with <unk> lifestyle .
Again , we can see the importance of the environment and models surrounding a human being for his or her healthy development .
For example , <unk> occur up to half more frequently on the tables of obese children compared to the families of children with standard weight .
Over <unk> of obese children had <unk> chips for dinner the day before the research connected to the educational event called <unk> is No <unk> .
Moreover , the families of obese children do not <unk> sports . However , this concerns a majority of families of current <unk> - only 15% of the children said their parents find time for sports activities at least once a week .
The research was performed among 900 children .
The research took place at the end of last year &apos;s school <unk> it included almost 900 <unk> school children from throughout <unk> .
It was the second year of the <unk> is No <unk> event supported by both <unk> <unk> <unk> insurance company and <unk> .
So far , the project has been joined by over 12 thousand school children from 4th to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and sufficient sports activities represent key <unk> factors causing dramatically growing number of children who are either overweight or obese .
&quot; For example , only half of those <unk> said they have five meals a day , in the <unk> pattern , one of the basic <unk> of correct <unk> , &quot; one of the results of the research says .
No lunch and <unk> in the evening
<unk> <unk> that even relative details are crucial for healthy <unk> such as a regular time of family breakfast .
In the Czech Republic , only <unk> of <unk> &apos;s families have breakfast together .
In a majority of families , everyone has breakfast separately .
The worst <unk> was the fact that in one <unk> of <unk> people do not have breakfast at all .
Yet breakfast is the core of proper daily <unk> .
A survey has shown that <unk> are <unk> more often in the families of obese children .
<unk> everyone - regardless of their weight - drinks sweet soft drinks every day <unk>
<unk> over 40% of children do sports regularly , the number <unk> down to less than a half - 15% - when it comes to their parents .
<unk> your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed selected children <unk> boys and <unk> girls from 13 <unk> to <unk> their own menu based on selection offered and their taste and opinions .
&quot; <unk> <unk> of Czech children between 12 and 15 are far from ideal as regards healthy <unk> . &quot;
Their favourite meals include large number of <unk> , meat , and sweet dishes .
&quot; <unk> <unk> is the high <unk> of sweet soft drinks , &quot; the final report of the survey <unk> .
As the main <unk> for lunch , <unk> won very <unk> over <unk> .
However , children showed very little interest in <unk> , fish , and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> towards health
The survey also showed that children are willing to adjust their <unk> <unk> provided they are given correct information .
&quot; Many participants from the survey control group showed a significant shift of <unk> towards healthy food when <unk> a <unk> after the end of the <unk> is No <unk> educational <unk> , &quot; project results show .
This was quite significant , for example , in case of sweet soft drinks , where more children would begin to prefer <unk> water .
In addition , for their main course , children <unk> <unk> and fish more often , limiting sweet meals and <unk> .
A Stylist <unk> Also Be a Good <unk> , <unk> <unk>
In the opening article on stylist training , I was <unk> a bit about the amount of information in the <unk> lessons .
I had no idea what was coming .
<unk> by three experts from the <unk> <unk> tips for difficult <unk> and a seminar on how it works in <unk> .
And more is yet to come .
The closer we get to the final <unk> , the more information and practical tasks <unk> .
The training takes place every Saturday and Sunday , but it is really <unk> with information .
This time , together with <unk> , the Director , <unk> is not a single man in the <unk> we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not in perfect <unk> .
A majority of women are not perfectly <unk> .
One has a short <unk> , the other has a <unk> figure without proper <unk> , yet another is overweight .
A stylist must know how to <unk> <unk> wide <unk> , make the <unk> look longer , or add the <unk> necessary .
We were given tips on how to <unk> the figure of women such as <unk> Lopez , i.e. with <unk> <unk> and <unk> and narrow waist , and not to dress them too <unk> .
For example , if the difference between the waist and <unk> is such that the <unk> or <unk> do not fit , it is worth to have at least one piece <unk> .
You will definitely not regret the investment , as perfectly <unk> clothes are <unk> .
In a <unk> <unk> , you will feel much better than in one that <unk> <unk> , rolling up , <unk> out in your waist , etc .
<unk> figures , on the other hand , can wear clothes with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> .
Given the <unk> of such information and figure types , I am glad to have a whole week to sort it all out in my head .
Still , I fear it is too much , with regard to the <unk> we were given .
Each of the course participants was given a <unk> to create two <unk> <unk> day and night .
We must consider their current appearance , their fashion style , and figure type .
I am to dress <unk> <unk> whom you may know from the <unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
<unk> I <unk> , as she is so much easier to dress than , say , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who has recently gained about a <unk> <unk> , understand I am <unk> or the very young <unk> <unk> .
We must cut the clothes out of <unk> or find them on the Internet and print and <unk> process them .
<unk> , as the result is called , then <unk> our personal style and <unk> to graphic <unk> .
It is important to think about the graphic part of <unk> .
A stylist does not just dress physical people , but creates product pages in <unk> <unk> on specific instructions , for example , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , etc <unk>
This is what a stylist and designer , Mario <unk> , was telling us about .
But that was not until Sunday .
A stylist needs general knowledge
Saturday &apos;s <unk> , <unk> with information on figure types , was <unk> up by three guests from the field .
A stylist , <unk> <unk> a fashion designer , Jakub <unk> and a fashion <unk> , Ben <unk> .
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an <unk> , and a stylist should be able to use this fact .
A good stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in different ways .
In this case , <unk> is key .
For example , a <unk> <unk> may be worn in the standard way , over <unk> and <unk> , as a <unk> but it may also be worn on <unk> body , with <unk> , as a dress .
Another option is rolling up the <unk> or <unk> , and the entire look changes completely .
&quot; <unk> with it , &quot; he <unk> .
However , I <unk> the following advice the <unk> &quot; For your work , you need to know the rules perfectly . &quot;
<unk> you can start <unk> them , &apos; Jakub told us .
Here I finally understood why we <unk> all the <unk> and rules of what to combine with what and why , while in fashion <unk> we often see something else .
Not to mention fashion shows .
From Ben , the <unk> , I learned that a stylist must have more <unk> versions prepared than the number he is to take pictures of .
So , for a <unk> fashion story <unk> ten <unk> I have to be ready to create at least fifteen of them .
Now I also know that in the picture , a piece of clothing often looks and functions in combination with others completely different from reality .
We must therefore take that into consideration when creating an <unk> .
<unk> <unk> confirmed that image and style often are half the success .
Just look at <unk> , who is no <unk> singer , yet her image and marketing turned her into a worldwide star .
The <unk> towards stylist services is still rather cold in the Czech Republic .
Even famous people often consider it <unk> <unk> it is sufficient to be good at something , and how they look at it comes <unk>
And if someone finally lets us create their <unk> , then we should expect them to give us different <unk> size than what they really wear .
Then , we are left to Google and find out if the <unk> wrote something about a <unk> <unk> / losing weight , etc .
On Sunday , both <unk> and Mario were <unk> the fact that for a stylist it is not enough to know about fashion and be able to create an <unk> .
Our work chiefly consists of <unk> with people we <unk> it is therefore important to be a good <unk> .
To be able to estimate people , not to <unk> , and stick to one &apos;s opinion .
&quot; If a manager <unk> you to go through her clothes and add some nice pieces , you cannot throw out her entire <unk> telling her how <unk> the clothes are . &quot;
&quot; Find at least a few pieces you can praise , and recommend what to wear them with &quot; Mario says .
He also showed us what specifically a duty bag must contain .
That is the bag you <unk> around your waist to carry all the <unk> you need .
<unk> from the obvious things , such as <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , or safety <unk> , it should have a <unk> thread <unk> the stylist to use when taking pictures of products such as <unk> or <unk> special <unk> for holding the clothes in the back in case it is too large <unk> and similar things are <unk> as they damage the <unk> or a <unk> set .
To have some change from listening , and gain some practical experience , we learned how to properly <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Even when taking photographs in a studio where the surface is even , the <unk> might get damaged - not to mention shooting outside .
And so we were <unk> away .
You must not touch the shoes with the <unk> , to avoid any damage .
This requires real skill .
Mario pleased me by <unk> my job .
The skills mentioned are really not my <unk> of tea .
This is just a <unk> of what we heard during the second weekend course session .
I am beginning to realise that to be a professional stylist is no piece of <unk> , no matter what people say .
V Need for <unk> The Run takes place across America .
<unk>
An originally <unk> ride turned into a <unk> morning drive to work because of a series of completely <unk> and <unk> mistakes .
The <unk> were met to a certain point , but it does not matter since <unk> obviously wanted to do any extra work .
Before it was released , the new version <unk> The Run created high expectations .
It promised to shift the old Need For Speed racing series in a new <unk> the <unk> made it look like a game that might stand up in the action racing <unk> .
We were <unk> to see the sections where the main character gets out of the car and runs .
<unk> for the <unk> series though , in the end many things are different from what we expected .
The game represents a possibly <unk> <unk> race , but the whole is <unk> by several <unk> mistakes <unk> in the series for a number of years .
This means they are not really mistakes , but the expression of an <unk> <unk> of the developers .
The adventure opens very well .
You are introduced into a story , where the main character , <unk> , <unk> to solve some personal issues by participating in an illegal race across America .
You get in the car on the west coast , in San Francisco , and your task is to be the first one to reach New York .
The idea brings several interesting features .
The route is divided into ten stages , <unk> into over <unk> races .
This means each race takes place on a different route , and given stages are set in varied and interesting environments .
One thus does not feel the game <unk> offering the same things .
Despite the graphics being on the same level of previous parts of the series , some of the environments are very nice to look at .
Still , it is nothing <unk> .
<unk> through the desert , <unk> countryside , or high in <unk> mountains is <unk> very pleasant though .
In addition , the races are , from time to time , <unk> by an <unk> feature .
For example , in the desert , you get into a <unk> , significantly <unk> the visibility .
On the other hand , in the mountains , you have to be careful not to get under an <unk> .
<unk> races are ordered fairly well .
There are just a few types , but it is sufficient .
For a while , you try to <unk> a number of competitors <unk> a regular <unk> then you try to beat the time <unk> <unk> <unk> or you are in a <unk> with a single rival .
On top of everything else you sometimes come across the police who make your efforts more difficult .
The parts outside the car are new .
They are just interactive <unk> , where most of the time <unk> is running away from someone and you need to help him by <unk> the right <unk> at the right time .
<unk> difficult .
It is a surprise though , that these parts are much less in number than you would expect <unk> three to be <unk>
It actually turns out to be good for the game , because this feature does not get to be <unk> within what was already said , it is one of the things that make the game more <unk> .
The driving model follows the <unk> of the previous parts .
This means that it is nothing special <unk> , but it cannot be considered a negative .
If you are looking for a <unk> simulation , you will have to look elsewhere .
Still , this driving model is fully suitable for the action style racing , even though we could find better at the competition .
So far , everything is just right .
However , after some time , problems come .
In contrast with the driving model , the <unk> model is not that good .
From a game of this type , one does not expect complicated <unk> and <unk> , but when you have no idea , before <unk> into any object , how your car will act , something is not right .
<unk> , when <unk> or passing cars <unk> in common traffic , you sometimes <unk> touch the other car . Yet sometimes in nearly <unk> situation your car ends up in wild <unk> .
Or , crashed completely .
This is not such a big deal due to the <unk> system , but is enough to <unk> the fun .
The <unk> are done so that if you crash or get far off the track , the game takes you back to the last <unk> point .
Nevertheless , there are only five <unk> available per each race .
If you use them up , you have to start the race from the beginning .
This makes it an aid in case something does not work out , but you cannot rely on it completely .
<unk> the <unk> are not enough and you need to learn a given section of the race by heart .
A significant <unk> of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places .
For example , some turns have to be driven through in a specific way , otherwise you simply do not fit in .
At other times you meet civilian cars at a given place in the very same configuration , no matter if you come first , fifth , five <unk> earlier , or one minute later .
This is especially <unk> in situations where you can see how your rival drives through the two cars coming in the opposite direction so easily , while when you get there , the cars are already positioned so that you have to either drive around or slow down .
It makes no difference when you get to <unk> everything is set so that the situation always occurs just in front of your <unk> .
The competitors have other advantages , too .
While playing the game , you find several places , where , regardless of time , the same <unk> <unk> you at the very same spot .
This is most obvious at the end of the game , on a long bridge , where you are driving in the opposite direction .
Obviously , your rival has to get in front of you no matter what .
The thing is that when he is driving in front of you , he makes your vision worse , which causes you to crash the car a few times in the section .
One can understand the attempt at making the game more interesting and <unk> , but it is so obvious it gets <unk> quickly .
It &apos;s a pity , because despite the simple driving model , the game is <unk> and sometimes even so full of action you do not have time to pay attention to what is happening around you .
It is not important whether the reason you do not get <unk> is the concept with <unk> unique tracks , <unk> of races , or something else .
The idea of changing cars during races is unusual .
You have to watch out for gas stations along the way , as that is where you car may change despite the fact that in most of the cases the one you have is fully sufficient .
<unk> are divided into three categories .
Sports cars are suitable for <unk> strong American cars for straight <unk> <unk> and exotic <unk> cars for technical driving , such as along <unk> mountain tracks .
The key story mode is closely connected with the challenge <unk> these are the races in individual locations you know from the story .
Here , you gain both <unk> and experience points for your profile , common for both challenges and the story .
<unk> features <unk> <unk> getting a higher driver <unk> starting with cars and ending with profile <unk> .
Again , the profile is <unk> with an on-line <unk> function , which , among other things , <unk> the results you have reached with those of other players , and ensures community functions .
Yet another <unk> difficult to <unk> is the situation from the last race in the story .
You and your car get into a <unk> tunnel <unk> &apos;s say you <unk> where you speed down the tracks in the <unk> <unk> &apos;s say you <unk>
Your <unk> shows numbers from 150 to 200 km / h <unk> &apos;s say it <unk> when suddenly , a <unk> train comes running down from behind you , turning your car into a <unk> of <unk> metal .
For several days , our <unk> staff kept discussing whether when <unk> the game no one thought for a moment or whether its authors really think we are such <unk> .
The technical part of the game is nothing <unk> but the overall visual impression is mostly pleasant , sometimes even great .
It is a pity though , that in some dramatic moments , the recording , in some cases rather <unk> , <unk> .
This especially concerns accidents with large number of participants , where <unk> <unk> would not help you much <unk> .
The sound is all <unk> the <unk> is a matter of taste .
In order to please the <unk> possible young audience , the <unk> is &apos; <unk> in from all quarters <unk> but there probably will not be many people buying the game because of its music .
<unk> impression of Need for <unk> The Run is quite <unk> .
If the game avoided those clearly <unk> mistakes , we could <unk> say that The Run is the best part of <unk> for the past several years .
However , the game feels <unk> .
It surely is a nice entertainment , but prepare to be <unk> by the mistakes with the strength of airport <unk> .

EU <unk> <unk>
Czechs have the reputation of being negative and <unk>
&quot; Lisbon Treaty caused significant <unk> between individual institutions . &quot;
&quot; I did not expect it to be such a tough war . &quot;
&quot; It will take five or six years before the situation becomes somewhat stable , calm , and before all players get used to their new roles , &quot; EU <unk> <unk> Vicenová opened her <unk> at the Law Department <unk> .
She proved how true she is to her &quot; Clearly and openly about Europe &quot; motto in the very first part of her <unk> , where she described individual EU <unk> and the relationships between them in such a clear and <unk> , way that many <unk> from the UK Law <unk> could be <unk> .
Moreover , Vicenová praised the work of new long-term President of the European Council , Herman Van <unk>
&quot; At first , <unk> said he was <unk> , a <unk> office mouse who cannot fulfil any <unk> I have to say everyone was <unk> at how <unk> he <unk> his role . &quot;
&quot; He is a person who can listen to all <unk> member states , communicate with them perfectly , and who has a clear vision of where the EU should be <unk> . &quot;
She explained her new position of foreign affairs and security policy representative as a reply to a question: &quot; Who is the European Union ? <unk> phone number should I call ? <unk> i.e. as an important step to <unk> and better clarity of Union &apos;s policy towards countries such as China or India .
No One <unk> To <unk> Our <unk> <unk>
Vicenová further focused on the agenda crucial for the EU in the past , present , and near future .
She described Czech presidency from the year before last as a success .
Czechs were dealing with the coming financial <unk> they solved the as <unk> and organised the East <unk> Summit .
She said the fall of the government at the time was a great negative causing significant damage to the Czech Republic .
<unk> , Czech representatives in the EU has been very busy .
As the <unk> said , both the presidency and the following financial crisis caused an ongoing <unk> .
In addition , a new <unk> EU budget needs to be passed , which is very complicated due to the current crisis .
Whether the budget will be <unk> and <unk> which fields will be given <unk> which countries will be supported more and which <unk> all of that is on the coming agenda .
The <unk> reminded the key <unk> she took to <unk> &quot; About Europe , Clearly . &quot;
&quot; I really do not like all the <unk> , foreign words , and <unk> no one understands .
How are citizens supposed to understand that in Brussels , people are not trying to come up with <unk> or round <unk> , different size <unk> , or that someone wants to ban our <unk> <unk>
She also wants to use the EU environment better , and get more Czechs into European institutions .
<unk> Europe Is <unk>
The <unk> says Czechs are said to be <unk> as well as people <unk> the negative rather than the positive sides of things .
